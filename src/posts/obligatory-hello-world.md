I have been meaning to start a blog for a while now.
I first considered the idea back in 2019,
and I've jotted down post ideas occasionally since then.
I even worked on a design back in 2019,
but I never finished it.

This was unsurprising to me.
I've always been a notorious project-hopper.
I'd pick up an interesting side project for a few weeks,
until some other, more shiny idea came along and I'd start on that instead.
I've accumulated a larger project graveyard than I care to admit.

Lately though, I've been pushing against that.
My wife and I have been slowly working our way through _The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Bren√© Brown over the last few months.
In it, Brown discusses embracing our humanness and overcoming perfectionism and fear, and does so in a way that really hits deep.

> Research shows that perfectionism hampers success.
> In fact, it's often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life-paralysis.
> _Life-paralysis_ refers to all of the opportunities
> that we miss because we're too afraid to put anything out into
> the world that could be imperfect.
> It's also all of the dreams that we don't follow because of our
> deep fear of failing, making mistakes, and disappointing others.

I'm well aware that perfectionism and fear hold me back from just _doing_ things, but _oof_.
That description of life-paralysis hit me like a truck--I could
clearly see that I had indeed lost (and _was losing_) opportunities as a result of my perfectionism.

At the beginning of this year, I decided I'd finally start a blog.

## A beginning...

Well, here we are:
I can say I've officially started.
I'm both excited and nervous about putting my thoughts out into the world.
(Realistically, I know that comparatively few people
will ever even _read_ this blog, but the anxiety imps in my mind
typically aren't all that concerned with realism.)
Historically, my writing has mostly been stuff I keep to myself, with the occasional post of a musing or insight on Facebook.
I intend to change pace here and make this a semi-frequent channel for sharing my ideas and thoughts publicly.
That has a very different feel to it
than an occasional one-off post shared only with people I know.
It's a bit nerve-wracking.

However, it's also invigorating. Writing is a powerful way of making meaning of the complexity of life.
When shared with others, it is an
incredible tool for communication and the synthesis of new
ideas--as Mark Brooker puts it, [writing is magical](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html).
That community side of writing is something I've only rarely tapped into.
I'm excited to see others respond to, build on, and critique the imperfect thoughts I share here.
I'm also excited to develop my own ideas further through the conversations that ensue.

As part of starting this blog,
I have a few specific goals.
I want to note them here--mostly for myself, but also so that you,
as a reader, know what to expect.

1. **Write more for myself than I do here.** If all my writing
   were to be a public "performance piece", the personal meaning I
   derive from it would be reduced.^[I very much intend to be
   accessible and unpolished in my writing here--see goal
   #3--but, for me,
   the pressure of how my writing might be perceived by a reader
   changes how I relate to that writing.]
   Writing for myself is critical
   for my well-being and learning, in a way that writing
   publicly, by itself, can't fulfill.
   As such, I want to make sure that I continue that kind of
   writing, even while writing here on a regular basis.
2. **Read more of others' thoughts than I write here.** The
   beneficial communal effects of writing can't occur if I'm only
   speaking and not listening.
   Plus, "listen more than you speak" is a good rule to live by
   in general.
3. **Be unpolished.** I'm not going to let myself endlessly
   revise my writing.
   I'm going to choose to be okay with just hitting publish (or "rebase and merge", as the case may be), even when
   it doesn't feel perfect yet.
   As such, I also reserve the right to adjust my perspectives over time as I learn more.
   I'll try to update older articles as that happens, but please
   evaluate my writing and opinions as a _gestalt_, and know that I'm always trying to learn.

## ... in more ways than one

I'm also excited about starting this blog because of what it represents to me:
breaking that fear-barrier between me and publishing something I've created.
The design, the code, and the writing are all my own doing.
That's very different than doing a project for work
or for someone else.

My goal is to keep this momentum going,
not just in publishing more articles,
but in publishing other projects:
An art storefront site for my wife's art.
Some art of my own.
A web app that has gone through several iterations over the years
but has never been used by someone other than me.

I'm not saying all this to pat myself on the back--just to be
open and honest about where I'm at and where I hope to go from here.

I also hope this provides encouragement
to anyone else in the same boat.
The Internet today is filled with loud and confident voices.
If you don't feel confident or loud, you might feel out of place.

However, I think we need the quiet and hesitant voices now more
than ever.
In a world of absolutism and reductionism, we need unconfident, careful, nuanced thoughts.

As Chris Coyier put it: "You‚Äôve got a brain. Lemme hear that thing go. **Write some words at a URL.**"^[[üß†üí≠‚úèÔ∏è](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/11/%F0%9F%A7%A0%F0%9F%92%AD%E2%9C%8F%EF%B8%8F/). This article, and Chris' many other articles encouraging his readers to write, was another chip that helped tip the scales towards me actually doing this.]

## A brief guide to this blog

Most of my posts will fall into one of the two categories shown
on [the home page](/): [Software](/posts/software) and [Faith](/posts/faith). You can read more about my foundational beliefs in each of these two categories [on the About page](/about).

Occasionally, an article won't fit into these two categories. These articles, as well as the categorized ones, will be shown in
reverse chronological order on [All Posts](/posts).

This blog is also available as [an RSS/Atom feed](/feeds/feed.xml) and [a JSON feed](/feeds/feed.json).
