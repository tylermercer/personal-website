I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now. 2019 was when I first thought about it, and I've jotted down ideas in a Todoist project occasionally since then. I even worked on a design back in 2019, but it never got off the ground.

My wife and I have been slowly working our way through _The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Brene Brown over the last year or so. In the book, Brown discusses embracing our humanness and overcoming perfectionism and fear. I'm well aware that perfectionism and fear hold me back from just _doing_ things, but this book really drove it home for me.

> Research shows that perfectionism hampers success. In fact, it's often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life-paralysis. _Life-paralysis_ refers to all of the opportunities
> that we miss because we're too afraid to put anything out into
> the world that could be imperfect.
> It's also all of the dreams that we don't follow because of our
> deep fear of failing, making mistakes, and disappointing others.

_Oof_. That hit me like a truck. 

At the beginning of this year, inspired by other personal bloggers whose blogs I read occasionally^[[Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net) and [Bryce Wray](https://www.brycewray.com) are two bloggers who have been particularly influential.], I decided I'd finally do it.

Writing is something I do a lot of. Historically, it has mostly been stuff I keep to myself, with the occasional post of a musing or insight on Facebook.
