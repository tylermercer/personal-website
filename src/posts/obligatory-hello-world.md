I have been meaning to start a blog for a while now. I first considered the idea back in 2019, and I've jotted down ideas in a Todoist project occasionally since then. I even worked on a design back in 2019, but never shipped it.

This was unsurprising to me. I've always been a notorious project-hopper. I'd
pick up an interesting side project for a few weeks and then some
other, more shiny idea will come along and I'd start on that instead. I've accumulated a larger project graveyard than I care to admit.

Lately though, I've been pushing against that.
My wife and I have been slowly working our way through _The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Brene Brown over the last few months.
In it, Brown discusses embracing our humanness and overcoming perfectionism and fear, and does so in a way that really hits deep.

> Research shows that perfectionism hampers success. In fact, it's often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life-paralysis. _Life-paralysis_ refers to all of the opportunities
> that we miss because we're too afraid to put anything out into
> the world that could be imperfect.
> It's also all of the dreams that we don't follow because of our
> deep fear of failing, making mistakes, and disappointing others.

I'm well aware that perfectionism and fear hold me back from just _doing_ things, but _oof_. That description of life-paralysis hit me like a truck--I've
definitely felt that sense of loss of opportunity at times.

At the beginning of this year, I decided I'd finally do it.

## A Beginning...

Well, here we are. I can say I've officially started a blog. I'm both excited and very nervous about putting my thoughts out into the world. (Realistically, I know that comparatively few people 
will ever even read this blog, but the anxiety imps in my mind 
typically aren't all that concerned with realism.)
Historically, my writing has mostly been stuff I keep to myself, with the occasional post of a musing or insight on Facebook.
I intend to change pace here and make this a semi-frequent channel for sharing my ideas and thoughts publicly
That has a very different feel to it
than an occasional one-off post about an idea, typically shared with only those I know.

However, it's also invigorating. For me, writing is a powerful way of making meaning of the complexity of life. 
But at a community level, it's also an
incredible tool for communication and the synthesis of new ideas--as Mark Brooker puts it, [writing is magical](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html).
That community side of writing is something I've only rarely tapped into. I'm excited to see others respond to, build on, and critique the imperfect thoughts I share here. I'm also excited to develop my own thoughts further through the conversations that ensue.

I have two specific goals I'm setting as part of starting this blog:

1. **Write more for myself than I do here.** If all my writing were to be a public "performance piece", the personal meaning I derive from it would be reduced.^[I very much intend to be accessible and unpolished in my writing here, but, for me, the pressure of how my writing is perceived by a reader changes how I relate to that writing.] I have found over my life that writing for myself is critical for my well-being and learning, in a way that writing publicly, by itself, can't fulfill.
2. **Read more of others' thoughts than I write here.** The beneficial communal effects of writing can't occur if I'm only speaking and not listening. Plus, "listen more than you speak" is a good rule to live by in general.

## ... In More Ways Than One

I'm also excited about starting this blog because of what it represents to me: breaking that fear-barrier between me and publishing something I've created^[Technically I have published small projects before, but they were so small as to be almost trivial]. My next goal is to keep this momentum going,
not just in publishing more articles, but in publishing other projects: An art storefront site for my wife's art. Some art of my own. A web app that has gone through several iterations over the years but has never been used by someone other than me.

I'm not saying all this to pat myself on the back--just to be open and honest about where I'm at and where I hope to go from here. And, maybe, to give encouragement to anyone else in the same boat. The Internet today is filled with loud and confident voices. If you don't feel confident or loud, you might feel out of place.

However, I think we need those voices more than ever. In a world of absolutes and reductionism, we need your unconfident, careful, nuanced thoughts.

In the words of Chris Coyier: "You‚Äôve got a brain. Lemme hear that thing go. **Write some words at a URL.**"^[[üß†üí≠‚úèÔ∏è](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/11/%F0%9F%A7%A0%F0%9F%92%AD%E2%9C%8F%EF%B8%8F/). This article, and Chris' many other articles encouraging his readers to write, was another chip that helped tip the scales towards me actually doing this. Thanks, Chris!]

## A guide to this blog

Most of my thoughts will fall into one of the two categories shown
on [the home page](/): [Software](/posts/software) and [Faith](/posts/faith). You can read more about my foundational beliefs in each of these two categories [on the About page](/about).

Occasionally, an article won't fit into these two categories. These articles, as well as the categorized ones, will be shown in
reverse chronological order on [All Posts](/posts)

This blog is also available as [an RSS/Atom feed](/feeds/feed.xml) and [a JSON feed](/feeds/feed.json).
