I have been meaning to start a blog for a while now.
I first considered the idea back in 2019,
and I've jotted down post ideas occasionally since then.
I even worked on a design back in 2019,
but I never finished it.

This was unsurprising to me.
I've always been a notorious project-hopper.
I'd pick up an interesting side project for a few weeks,
until some other, more shiny idea came along and I'd start on that instead.
I've accumulated a larger project graveyard than I care to admit.

Lately though, I've been pushing against that.
My wife and I have been slowly working our way through
_The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Bren√© Brown over the last few months.
In it, Brown discusses embracing our humanness
and overcoming perfectionism and fear. Quoting from the book:

> Research shows that perfectionism hampers success.
> In fact, it's often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life-paralysis.
> _Life-paralysis_ refers to all of the opportunities
> that we miss because we're too afraid to put anything out into
> the world that could be imperfect.
> It's also all of the dreams that we don't follow because of our
> deep fear of failing, making mistakes, and disappointing others.

_Oof_. That description of life-paralysis hit me like a truck--I could
clearly see that I had indeed lost (and _was losing_) opportunities as a result
of my perfectionism and fear of judgment.

At the beginning of this year,
with the encouragement of my wife,
I decided I'd finally do it.

## A beginning...

I'm both excited and nervous about putting my thoughts out into the world.
Historically, my writing has mostly been stuff I keep to myself,
with the occasional post of a musing or insight on Facebook.
I intend to change pace here and make this a semi-frequent
channel for sharing my ideas and thoughts publicly.
That has a very different feel to it
than an occasional one-off post shared only with people I know.
It's a bit nerve-wracking.
(Realistically, I know that comparatively few people
will ever even _read_ this blog, but the anxiety imps in my mind
typically aren't all that concerned with realism.)

However, it's also invigorating. Writing is a powerful way of
making meaning of the complexity of life.
When shared with others, it is an
incredible tool for communication and the synthesis of new
ideas.^[Mark Brooker discusses this idea in ["Writing is magic"](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html).]
That community side of writing is something I've only rarely tapped into.
I'm excited to see others respond to, build on, and critique the imperfect thoughts I share here.
I'm also excited to develop my own ideas further through the conversations that ensue.

As part of starting this blog,
I have a few specific goals.
I want to note them here--mostly for myself, but also so that you,
as a reader, know what to expect.

1. **Write more for myself than I do here.** If all my writing
   were to be a public "performance piece", the personal meaning I
   derive from it would be reduced.^[I very much intend to be
   accessible and unpolished in my writing here--see goal
   #3--but, for me,
   the pressure of how my writing might be perceived by a reader
   changes how I relate to that writing.]
   Writing for myself is critical
   for my well-being and learning, in a way that writing
   publicly, by itself, can't fulfill.
   As such, I want to make sure that I continue that kind of
   writing, even while writing here on a regular basis.
2. **Read more of others' thoughts than I write here.** The
   beneficial communal effects of writing can't occur if I'm only
   speaking and not listening.
   Plus, "listen more than you speak" is a good rule to live by
   in general.
3. **Be unpolished.** I'm not going to let myself endlessly
   revise my writing.
   I'm going to choose to be okay with just hitting publish (or "rebase and merge", as the case may be), even when
   it doesn't feel perfect yet.
   As such, I also reserve the right to adjust my perspectives over time as I learn more.
   I'll try to update older articles as that happens, but please
   evaluate my writing and opinions as a _gestalt_, and know that I'm always trying to learn.

## ... in more ways than one

I'm also excited about starting this blog because of what it represents to me:
breaking that fear-barrier between me and publishing something I've created.
The design, the code, and the writing of this site are all my own creation.
I didn't use a blog starter template or a CSS library or have any
design or branding decisions handed to me at the start of this project.
This website is "my thoughts" not just textually
but at a design and engineering level as well.

That's pretty cool, when you think about it.
I made a thing, from scratch, that other people can enjoy.^[
   See ["Make Free Stuff"](https://mxb.dev/blog/make-free-stuff/) by Max B√∂ck]
I can share it with them simply by handing them a sequence of characters
(`https://tylermercer.net`)^[
   URLs are *so dang cool* when you think about it.
   I need to write more about this.]
It's a peice of my mind that people anywhere in the world
can experience and (hopefully) relate to.
Heck, that's not just cool, that's _electrifying_!

My goal is to keep this momentum going,
not just in publishing more articles,
but in publishing other projects:
a website for my wife's art;
a passion project web app that has gone through
several iterations but has never been shared;
maybe even some art of my own (made with HTML + CSS, of course).

I'm not saying all this to pat myself on the back--just to be
open and honest about where I'm at and where I hope to go from here.

I also hope this provides encouragement
to anyone else in the same boat.
The Internet today is filled with loud and confident voices and creators.
If you don't feel confident or loud, you might feel out of place.

However, I think we need the quiet and hesitant creators now more than ever.
In a world of absolutism and reductionism, we desperately need
unconfident, careful, nuanced thoughts.
We need people creating cool things just for the sake of it--whether
that's a blog, a web app, art, or something else.

To borrow and expand on the words of Chris Coyier, "you‚Äôve got a brain.
Lemme hear [or see] that thing go. 
Write some words [or put some art or a web app] at a URL."^[

   encouraging his readers to write, 
   was another thing that helped tip the scales towards me actually doing this.
