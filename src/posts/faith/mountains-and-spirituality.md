In the scriptures, mountains are often spiritually significant places.
At first glance this might seem uninteresting,
as heaven is traditionally seen as being above the earth,
but it occurred to me that the more important thing may be
that they bring us away from the world.

The height of a mountain imposes a necessary solitude
and isolation upon its summit,
and this removal of the self from the
distractions of the world is significant
in allowing God to speak to us.

Furthermore, it is not simply the distance between us
and the voices of the world
that provides the necessary mental isolation--it
is the difficulty of that distance.
Physically, humans have never been significantly deterred by horizontal distance.
Civilizations span plains and forests and cross rivers and oceans.
Rarely does a civilization extend upwards to a mountain's summit.
The summit is almost always occupied only by those who
deliberately go there despite the difficult journey.

Are we willing to deliberately go where we can be mentally and spiritually present with God?
