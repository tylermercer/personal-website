Today I signed the
["Pause Giant AI Experiments" petition](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)
at FutureOfLife.org.

I believe AI will change our future dramatically,
and we should not rush headlong into those changes.
AI research beyond the level of current Chat AI systems
deserves careful ethical consideration.

I encourage everyone who reads this to sign the petition
as well. This is a pivotal moment in history, and we
need to make sure it pivots in the favor of humanity.

I'm not against AI as a concept. In fact, I'm currently
working on a project that will hopefully benefit greatly
from it. But there is a lot riding on how we as a species
approach the development of powerful AI systems.
Depending on the decisions we make, they could either
improve life for the majority of mankind or improve life
for only a tiny minority at the expense of the majority.
