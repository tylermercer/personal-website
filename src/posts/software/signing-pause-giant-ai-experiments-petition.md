Today I signed the
["Pause Giant AI Experiments" petition](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)
at FutureOfLife.org.

I believe AI will change our future dramatically,
and we should not rush headlong into those changes.
AI research beyond the level of current Chat AI systems
deserves careful ethical consideration.

I encourage everyone who reads this to sign the petition
as well. This is a pivotal moment in history, and we
need to make sure it pivots in the favor of humanity.
