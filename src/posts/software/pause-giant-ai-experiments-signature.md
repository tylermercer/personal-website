This post confirms that I have signed Future of Life's
["Pause Giant AI Experiments" petition](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/).

I believe AI will change our future dramatically,
and we should not rush headlong into those changes.
AI research beyond the level of current Chat AI systems
deserves careful ethical consideration.
