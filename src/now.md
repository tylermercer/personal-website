I am currently working at Brevium, where I collaborate with some amazing people 
and use ASP.NET, Blazor, HTML, Typescript, Tailwind, WPF, and Microsoft SQL Server. I 
manage the code side of Brevium's budding design system.

Outside of work, I've been doing a lot with 11ty, Astro, CUBE CSS, Solid, Supabase, 
Fauna, and Cloudflare Workers. 

I've also been reading _The Gifts of Imperfection_ 
by Brene Brown with my wife Evelyn, and just finished _Indistractible_ by Nir 
Eyal.^[I started _Indistractible_ a while ago and got most of the way through 
it, but finally picked it up again a few weeks ago. You could say I got 
distracted.] I highly recommend both books.

## What's this?
The /now page movement was started by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)^[Perhaps more accurately, it was started by Gregory Brown, who saw what Derek had done and did the same thing.]. From [the page he created to explain it](https://nownownow.com/about):

> Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
> ...
> So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
> ... **Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.** ... That's what a now page is for.
