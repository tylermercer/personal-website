title: A Different Kind of “Hello, World!”
description: Welcome to our messy blue marble, Isabella

Had an exciting surprise a couple weeks ago---my daughter was born! She came a
couple weeks early, but we are so glad she's here safely. ❤️ She and Evelyn are
both doing well now.

I've written before about
[the journey of faith](/post/faith/certainty-and-uncertainty-as-elements-of-faith)
that Evelyn and I went through with our desires to have children. Our need for
faith to accept uncertainty has not diminished---some scary complications in the
delivery process required us to place our faith in God even more firmly. But He
intervened in some miraculous ways and provided protection and safety for both
my wife and our daughter.
