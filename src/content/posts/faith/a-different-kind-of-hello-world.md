I've written before about
[the journey of faith](/post/faith/certainty-and-uncertainty-as-elements-of-faith) we went through. We struggled to find one that (a) we both liked and (b) worked well in
English and Spanish. Even when faced with
uncertainty---in our fertility journey, in the arduous pregnancy, and in the
tumultuous delivery---we found strength in the "oaths" or promises God had made
to us as part of our covenants with Him, especially the promise that
[our family would be eternal](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/welcome/families-together-forever?lang=eng)
no matter what happened in this life.

(We finalized the name as _Isabella_ instead of _Isabelle_ because we liked the
cadence more, and preferred the diminutive form of "Bella" over "Belle," but the
name's origin is the same.)

I can't wait to see the impact you have on it---you've changed _my_ world so much already. ❤️
