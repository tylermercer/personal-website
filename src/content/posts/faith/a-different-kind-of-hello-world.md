Something special happened a couple weeks ago: my daughter was born! She came a
couple weeks early due to some sudden complications, but we are so glad she's
here and that she's okay. She and Evelyn are both doing well now.

I've written before about
[the journey of faith](/post/faith/certainty-and-uncertainty-as-elements-of-faith)
that Evelyn and I went through with our desires to have children. Our need for
faith to accept uncertainty hasn't diminished---scary complications in the
delivery process required us to place our faith in God even more firmly.
Gratefully, He intervened in some miraculous ways, and provided protection and
safety for both my wife and our daughter.

For the duration of the pregnancy, people would ask us if we had picked a name
yet, but we struggled to find one that (a) we both liked and (b) worked well in
English and Spanish. For the last month or so of the pregnancy I would jokingly
tell people that we had everything except the name. But as I scanned through the
list of possible names we had prepared, one name stood out: Isabelle. The name
comes from the Spanish _Isabel_, which was derived from the English _Elisabeth_,
which in turn comes from the Hebrew _Elisheva_, meaning "My God is my oath."

This seemed well-suited for a daughter whose conception and now safe delivery
were merciful and tender blessings to us from a loving God. Even when faced with
uncertainty---in our fertility journey, in the arduous pregnancy, and in the
tumultuous delivery---we found strength in the "oaths" or promises God had made
to us as part of our covenants with Him, especially the promise that
[our family would be eternal](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/welcome/families-together-forever?lang=eng)
no matter what happened in this life.

(We finalized the name as _Isabella_ instead of _Isabelle_ because we liked the
cadence more, and preferred the diminutive form of "Bella" over "Belle," but the
name's origin is the same.)

Welcome to the world, Isabella! It's a beautiful place. I can't wait to see the
impact you have on it. You've changed _my_ world so much already. ❤️
