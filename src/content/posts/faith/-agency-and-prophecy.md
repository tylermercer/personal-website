Today I read
[Acts 27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/27?lang=eng).
It’s a gripping account of a perilous voyage Paul took towards Rome. Before
departing from a place called The Fair Havens (which, ironically, was "not
commodious to winter in", as mentioned in
[verse 12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/27?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)),
Paul prophesied that the journey would be a dangerous one, with "hurt and much
damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives." The centurion
leading the group didn’t believe him, and the sailors wanted to leave rather
than to winter at The Fair Havens, so they did so. Eventually, they were caught
in a horrible storm, but through the prophetic reassurance and guidance of Paul
(who, midway through the voyage, told them that God would spare all their
lives), they were able to make it safely to land.

One lesson I see in this story is that we need to persist in using our agency to
try to do good within the bounds the prophet has set, and not adopt an identity
of helplessness or resignation in the face of adversity. Interestingly, even
though they had been told by Paul that the ship would be lost, the sailors tried
to save the
ship.^[[verse 38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/27?lang=eng&id=p38#p38),
"they lightened the ship";
[verse 39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/27?lang=eng&id=p39#p39),
"but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were
minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship"; and
[verse 40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/27?lang=eng&id=p40#p40),
"[they] made toward shore"] As a result of their efforts, the ship ran aground
and was destroyed near enough to the shore that all the passengers were able to
swim or float to land.

If the sailors, who knew the ship would be lost, had not attempted to save it by
sailing into the mouth of the creek, they likely would not have survived. As
they acted within their capability and within the prophetic guidance given by
Paul (e.g. they abandoned the lifeboat at his counsel in
[verses 31-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/27?lang=eng&id=p31-p32#p31)),
the Lord intervened to provide their salvation. I think this applies in our own
lives as well. We know through prophecy that the world is tending towards peril,
particularly spiritually. The prophecies in the scriptures tell of a lot of
destruction and suffering in the latter days. But if we are to be good stewards
of that which has been entrusted to us by God, we must still make a concerted
effort---our best effort---to survive and thrive temporally and spiritually
under these conditions, and to help others to do so as well.
