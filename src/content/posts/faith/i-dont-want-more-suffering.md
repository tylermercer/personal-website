I had a neat thought when reading
[Alma 34:11-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p11-p14#p11)
today:

> **11** Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone
> for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which
> is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.
>
> **12** But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there
> can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for
> the sins of the world.
>
> **13** Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice,
> and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the
> shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be
> all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.
> 
> **14** And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to
> that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son
> of God, yea, infinite and eternal.

As I read verse 13, I saw the "stop to the shedding of blood" as connected to
verses 11 and 12 and not just to the animal sacrifices under the law of Moses
mentioned in the preceding verses. This connection is perhaps eisegetical, but
I think it's significant---God sent His son to "fulfill the demands of justice"
because justice demands _our_ blood. Justice demands "an eye for an eye," which
means that, without a Savior, there would just be more pain and suffering in
response to the pain and suffering we inflict on others. God yearns to _stop_ the
pain and suffering, not to have it propagate unbounded. Thus, He sent His Son that
there could be "a stop to the shedding of blood." I'm reminded of a quote from
_The Brothers Karamazov_, in which a man named Ivan expresses his dissatisfaction
with the idea of a God whose primary goal is justice:

> What do I care for avenging them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors?
> ... I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don't want more suffering. ... And
> so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am
> bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It's not God
> that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket.

Fortunately, God agrees with Ivan. He _also_ doesn't want more suffering. He
_also_ wants to embrace and to forgive.
