title: 2025 Goals
description: Some things I'm aiming at this year
---
As a lot of people do, I tend to think more about bigger picture goals around the start of the new 
year. Here are some goals I've had on my mind, and specific things I'm doing to reach for them.

## Be physically healthier

To do this, I'm focusing on two things:
1. Minimize intake of refined sugar.
2. Move more. I've implemented this by getting a treadmill base for my standing desk. Last December, when I decided to do this, I set up a step-tracking app on my phone, so that I could monitor my step counts before and after getting the treadmill base. I also have been tracking in my notes how many hours I walk each day.
