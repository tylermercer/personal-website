[Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/multi-armed-bandit):

> Perform experiments. By this I don’t mean do random things. I mean, STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS and FIND WAYS TO TEST IF THEY ARE FALSE. Most of the time, the slot machine of an experiment yields nothing. But that’s ok. A few will rearrange the world around you. \[In this case, I was implicitly testing certain assumptions by building Logwise. I needed to face up to the fact that they were false.\]

> When \[becoming a father] ate about half my time, I had to force myself to make priorities: *I would care for \[my daughter], I would write, and I would say no to everything else*. Narrowing my life like this, at least doubled how much I could achieve. When I had more time, I had spread myself too thin to get stuff done.

> Jony Ives: "One of the things Steve \[Jobs] would say \[to me] because he was worried I wasn’t focused — he would say, “How many things have you said no to?” I would tell him I said no to this. And I said no to that. But he knew I wasn’t interested in doing those things. There was no *sacrifice* in saying no \[to those things]. What focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a phenomenal idea, you wake up thinking about it, but you say no to it because you are focusing on something else"

> These days, I’ll spend the afternoon playing with the kids, doing the dishes, repairing the houses—being busy in a mind-clearing way. Then, when I sit down to write the next morning, I can type 700 words without thinking. The ideas have been churning in my head, just below the surface of conscious thought, and come fully formed.

Me ([2024-08-01](obsidian://open?vault=personal-writing&file=Spiritual%20Notes%2FJournal%2F2024-08-01))

> I've been thinking exclusively about my app in the mornings, and while the progress I've made on it has been satisfying, it doesn't feed my soul.
> 
> I need to write. Specifically, I need to write about eternal truths in ways that change how I think, how I see the world, and who I am. I've realized that that's what writing---good, thorough writing---does for me. An example is my essay ["Certainty and Uncertainty as Elements of Faith"](<https://tylermercer.net/posts/faith/certainty-and-uncertainty-as-elements-of-faith/>), which I published on my personal website last September. The ideas and connections that I formed as I thought through and refined that essay have changed how I approach the concepts of faith, uncertainty, and humility. [*Innerhelm*](<https://innerhelm.com/>), as a project, has had similar effects, but I've stopped writing for it, and as such have stopped reaping the intellectual and spiritual benefits.

> Building something cool, useful, and challenging in Logwise is satisfying, but not in the right ways. It doesn't lead me to discovering new tools with which I can interact with the world, and learning and growing in truth and understanding.

> I've gotta start writing again---the kind of writing that refines my thinking.

Kohn ([The Downside of “Grit” (Commentary)](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/downside-grit/)]):

> To begin with, not everything is worth doing, let alone doing for extended periods, and not everyone who works hard is pursuing something worthwhile.  People who are up to no good often have grit to spare.  Persistence is just one of many attributes that can sometimes be useful for reaching a (good or bad) outcome, so it’s the choice of goal that ought to come first and count more.

> Hence the proverbial Law of Holes:  When you’re in one, stop digging.

> Gritty people sometimes exhibit what psychologists call “nonproductive persistence”: They try, try again even though the result may be either unremitting failure or “a costly or inefficient success that could have been easily surpassed by alternative courses of action,” as Dean McFarlin at the State University of New York and his colleagues put it in the Journal of Personality.  Even if you don’t crash and burn by staying the course, you may not fare nearly as well as if you had stopped, reassessed, and tried something else.

> The benefits of knowing when not to persist extend not only to the outcomes of a decision but to the effects on the individual who made it.  Following a year-long study of adolescents, Canadian researchers Gregory Miller and Carsten Wrosch concluded that those “who can disengage from unattainable goals enjoy better well-being…and experience fewer symptoms of everyday illness.”

> Even the achievement claims seem less persuasive when you look closely.  Are more A’s given to students who report that they put off doing what they enjoy until they finish their homework (as one study found)?  Sure. In other words, those who do what they’ve been told,  regardless of whether it’s satisfying or sensible, are rewarded by those who told them to do it. \[Maybe tie in _Wanting_ here. I was "told" what to do by the models I emulated.]

> \[Duckworth's] value judgment, in other words, is that children should spend their time trying to improve at one thing rather than exploring, and becoming reasonably competent at, several things.  But for anyone who favors breadth and variety in life, no reason has been offered to prefer a life of specialization. \[Karlsson's approach makes a lot more sense. Focus is more valuable when your exploration has helped you determine _what_ to focus on.]

Rubin ([_Better Than Before_](obsidian://open?vault=resource-notes&file=Books%2FBetter%20Than%20Before)) — habits reduce mental load, and bright line rules can enforce habits

> To achieve greater clarity in my actions, I often invoke a "bright- line rule," a useful concept from law. A bright-line rule is a clearly defined rule or standard that eliminates any need for interpretation or decision making; for example, observing the Sabbath, or using The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage to decide grammar questions, or never buying bottled water, or answering every email within twenty-four hours, or calling home every Sunday night are bright-line rules.

- Why was I pursuing this project at all? Hyperfocus and the semi-addictive nature of building a working thing explained why I _continued_, but why had I _started_ this project? What were my higher-level reasons for wanting to build Logwise? Surely there would be something more meaningful at that level of motivation.
