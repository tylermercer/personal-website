I spent the last six months building a web application called [Logwise](https://logwise.tylermercer.net). It's an app for logging things: sleep quality, focus levels, research insights, health symptoms, or anything else you'd like to monitor over time. It works offline (via [Dexie](https://dexie.org/) and [Dexie Cloud](https://dexie.org/cloud/)) and allows you to change the schema of your logs over time without data loss (via [persistent data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)).

It's been a compelling project for me---the kind that I wake up thinking about, and for which I have a constant flow of exciting ideas.

But I've decided to open-source and archive the repo, and to throw away my roadmap.[^throwing-away] I'm "unlaunching" it---declaring it done, and putting it out into the world like a launch, but with the intent to put a firm lid on the project.

- TLDR as above
- Juggling two projects
	- Introduce Andy Matuschak
	- Draw parallel between Matuschak and myself
		- Explain Innerhelm, and Logwise's connection to it
		- Use quote about switching costs (March and October one)
	- Matuschak had good reason to want to reconcile his experience switching between two projects. Did I?
	- The non-essentialist lie that you can do it all
	- Explore vs exploit
	- The biggest risk is not finding a bad balance between exploring and exploiting. The biggest risk is _spending too much time pulling a sub-optimal lever.
- Why Logwise was the wrong lever
	- _Essentialism_
		- Contributing at highest impact 
			- Innerhelm higher than Logwise (more on this later)
		- But was this just because I hadn't yet shipped Logwise?
		- "If it's not hell yes, it should be a no." Logwise _felt_ like a yes!
	- Diminished self
		- This was a "quietly destructive act wrapped in \[a] cloak of creation." (_Irresistible_)
		- As I saw over a year ago
		- Matuschak's experience with this
		- Contrast with expanded self when writing
			- Journal entry about writing that changes who I am
	- Partly was due to hyperfocus
		- Reinforced through focusing on functionality---a poor proxy of software quality---over actual usefulness
	- Karlsson's subconscious writing thoughts vs my very-much-conscious, life-decaying engineering thinking
		- Writing gets me closer to real life, whereas in engineering mode it is abstracted away
		- (Footnote) Work doesn't have the same problem, since I don't have complete creative control over my projects there. The highly collaborative nature of the work puts a limit on how much progress I can make on my own, especially outside of working hours.
	- Why was I pursuing this project at all? Hyperfocus and the semi-addictive nature of building a working thing explained why I _continued_, but why had I _started_ this project? What were my higher-level reasons for wanting to build Logwise? Surely there would be something more meaningful at that level of motivation.
		- There wasn't.
		- Mimetic desire explains Logwise's facade of "yes" (_Wanting_)
			- My long-term goals with Logwise were highly mimetic. At the heart of it, I wanted to create a widely-used app, because that was what I've seen modeled by people I look up to. That core mimesis was surrounded by derivative goals, like making the app financially viable, but the central focus of the project was not about money; it was about achieving the status of "I've built a successful app." And the reason I sought for that status was because of mimesis. This mimetic desire leeches off of my values-motivated desire to make something that is useful---but I've already done that in Innerhelm
		- The "yes-ness" was inarticulable.
		- I was not being agentic---I was riding, not driving. Ironic for someone ostensibly exploring agency thinking!
	- Aversion to quitting (maybe)
		- [TODO] Unpack Kohn's essay
	- Jony Ive on focus (maybe move lower?)
		- (Maybe tie in ideas from Brian Lee at LegalZoom)
		- Focusing on the known good outcome of Innerhelm made this clearer
		- Grandpa's gratitude (just mention him as one of my readers)
- What I'm doing about it
	- "Law of Holes"
	- Switching didn't work, as mentioned before
	- Higher order agency, which I've mentioned before
		- I would create a bright line rule
		- Rubin on the power of habits to reduce decisional load
		- By open-sourcing Logwise and writing publicly about this decision, I've created a _commitment pact_.
			- (Footnote) Open-sourcing also satisfies my compulsion to not "waste" crystallized knowledge.
		- It also leverages our inherent bias for consistency as humans to enforce my decision.
			- Maybe quote Kahneman from Thinking Fast and Slow here?
	- Even continuing to _use_ the application while not working on it had proved risky. Reimplementing in Obisidian
- Conclusion
	- I worried that I would feel constrained---like "a wild bull caught in a net," to borrow a metaphor from Isaiah. But I haven't.
		- Karlsson: "as a person for whom narrow focus is against my instincts, the most remarkable thing about it is how rich it feels"
	- Takeaways:
		- Not everything that feels compelling is worth spending time on
		- Challenge your assumptions. "The only way someone can be of help to you..."

[^throwing-away]: I should note that I didn't delete the Todoist project with my roadmap for Logwise; I only archived it. I had a lot of knowledge and resources captured in my notes there, and, despite my minimalist approach to _physical_ possessions, I struggle to discard conceptual ones such as crystallized knowledge. But archiving the project satisfies the requirement of intentionally making it hard to pick the project up again.
