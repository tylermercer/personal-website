If you spend any amount of time writing web UI's, you're likely to have come across code that is described as _declarative_ or _imperative_, usually with declarative code being framed as a good thing and imperative code as a bad thing.

The difference between these two forms of code is often explained as "what" versus "how": _declarative_ code declares _what_ a thing is, whereas _imperative_ code is _how_ a thing is done.

But that's pretty nebulous, and not very actionable.

A much better definition is given by Josh Morony in his excellent video ["A visual guide to why declarative code is better"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnaThaXb7JM):

> Declarative code [is code] where the definition of a thing and how it can change over time is contained entirely within the declaration of that thing.

He gives examples of what this looks like in practice, along with a great explanation of why declarative code is better, in the video.
