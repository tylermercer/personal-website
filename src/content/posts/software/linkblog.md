title: Adding a Linkblog to This Site
description: I come across a lot of neat thingsâ€”might as well share them here.

A few of the bloggers I follow, in addition to publishing longer-form writing,
use their blog almost as one would use Twitter---for sharing short thoughts,
often just a link with some commentary.

This idea of sharing links-with-brief-commentary is known among
[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) writers as a
[linkblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog).

Different folks implement this in different ways:

* [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/) includes his link-with-commentary
  posts in the same place as the rest of his posts (though sometimes
  [without titles](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/03/03/11148/), which is very
  fascinating).
* [Dan Mall](https://danmall.com/) uses a unified feed as well, but gives the
  link posts [a dedicated tag](https://danmall.com/topics/link/) and
  [a unique page template](https://danmall.com/posts/links/choose-to-be-bad/)
  that puts the external link front and center on the page.
* [Jim Nielsen](https://www.jim-nielsen.com/) separates his writing across
  subdomains, putting his traditional blog at `blog.jim-nielsen.com` and his
  linkblog at `notes.jim-nielsen.com`. He describes the latter as feeding the
  former, which I think is a good way to go. It almost gives me
  [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) vibes, where
  thoughts begin as seeds and grow into more detailed things.

I've decided to add a linkblog to this site as well. Mine aims to incorporate
the parts I like about each of the approaches I've seen others use, by having a
dedicated area on the site for links, without going so far as to put it on its
own subdomain. You can [check it out here](/links/1).

I opted for the separate-feeds approach because these two feeds will be _vastly_
different in terms of publish frequency: I actually crosspost my links from a
few channels on a private chat server I use with my family, where I often share
things with my technically-minded siblings [Dan](https://danmercer.net/),
[E.J.](https://mercer.dev), and
[Russell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-mercer/).

Most of the links I share are of a technical nature, but I'll also occasionally
share links relating to UI/UX design or behavioral science.

(Here's hoping this can help me publish more longer-form posts as well. ðŸ˜…)
