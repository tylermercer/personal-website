title: Degrees of Thoroughness
description: Towards an effective personal writing process
---
A few months back, I came across [some (unnamed?) person's thoughts on procrastination](https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-i-cured-procrastination/) and how they overcame it. They argue that procrastination is a "limbic response" where your brain tries to defer pain to avoid it, but by so doing makes it more intense. That intensity reinforces the deferral behavior---clearly if it was _that bad_, it was a good thing to defer. This becomes "a vicious cycle of pushing off work, leading to higher peak pain, leading to pushing off work more, leading to even more peak pain, etc. Every iteration of this cycle your brain gets another dose of suffering and further associates work with pain."

This "limbic response" model of procrastination resonates strongly with my personal experience. When I read this, I realized this vicious cycle had poisoned my relationship with writing specifically. I procrastinated basically every essay in school (and they typically turned out decent enough regardless, which only served to further reinforce the habit). By the time I graduated, I had more or less accepted that putting off my essays to the last minute was just how I wrote good essays.

When I started _Innerhelm_ last year, I fell back to that strategy again, writing each newsletter in a mad scramble each Thursday night---since, initially, I had promised to send a new newsletter each Thursday. (Unlike my writing in school, where the pressure of a grade led me to at least come up with an outline in my head before sitting down to write, these newsletters were pretty off-the-cuff, and as such weren't even the sort of writing I felt good about.) I really didn't enjoy falling back into that habit, and I realized that dumping my nascent thoughts into a rushed newsletter was not giving me time to refine my ideas. I decided to [pivot to publishing less frequently](https://innerhelm.com/newsletters/a-change-in-cadence/). But I still didn't know how to write well without deadlines, and (coupled with the distraction of Logwise) I wound up just not writing at all for most of last year.

But once I saw procrastination as a vicious cycle of self-reinforcing fear, I realized this rushed approach to writing _wasn't_ a fundamental part of how I write; it was something I had *learned*, and something which I could, with effort, unlearn. I needed to figure out how to approach my writing similarly to how I approached my coding projects, like Logwise—by breaking it into small, rewarding chunks that I could complete frequently, instead of big stressful crunch-time effort.

## A rough process

At this point, you might be expecting me to say "here's how I solved it." Unfortunately, I haven't arrived at a complete solution yet---hence why I haven't written anything for _Innerhelm_ since publishing "Unlaunching" last December. But I realized the other day that there's a pattern to how I wrote "Unlaunching" that could provide a healthier, more incremental alternative to the deadline-fueled procrastination writing I used in the past.

In broad strokes, here's the process I followed in writing "Unlaunching," and which I'm considering using going forward:

1. Brain dump my initially-congealed thoughts about the topic, journal entry style. 
2. Think more, and list all the quotes and resources (as text, not as links) that seem relevant as I think about it.
3. Think more, and write out an outline with references to points and quotes from the brain dump and quotes list.
4. Tackle the outline piecemeal, but in order, so I can adapt it organically as I go through it.
5. Run the completed essay by my review group (a handful of friends whose critical judgment I trust and who I can rely on for candid feedback).
6. Tighten based on the feedback (by making a list of feedback tasks and addressing a few in each sitting).

## Degrees of thoroughness

Thinking about this further, I realized something nice about it: I have a _thing_ after each step, and a potentially-publishable _thing_ after three of those steps (1, 4, and 6). This makes it an iterative, incremental approach to writing, rather than an all-or-nothing waterfall-style approach, which lowers the risk and activation energy of tackling a given piece. It offers three low-friction early ejection points (after steps 1, 4, and 5) and two higher-friction points (I could write a simple essay based on what I have after step 2 or 3).

In a sense, it's a set of three degrees of thoroughness:
1. Written
2. Written based on an outline
3. Written based on an outline and reviewed by others

Some writing—such as [my post about my linkblog](/posts/linkblog), or this post—only deserves to be a 1 or 2. Other writing, such as "Unlaunching," I want to be a 3.

But, importantly, the incrementality of this approach offers a smooth upgrade path. If I were so inclined, I could "upgrade" this post to a 3 by refining the outline, reassembling the thoughts I already have here according to that outline, and running it by my review group for feedback.

I used to write everything in one sitting in part because writing in stages seemed like more work. But that's like saying waterfall software development is less work than Agile software development. What you eliminate in "work," you end up taking on as risk and stress instead. You run the risk of wasting the _whole thing_ (like my early Innerhelm newsletters) instead of just wasting parts of it (such as, the parts from the brain dump that I don't include in the outlined essay, or the parts of the outlined essay that I cut based on feedback).

## Fine-tuning

There are some additional levers I'm trying to pull in my writing this year, to make this process work even better than it did for "Unlaunching." One is to _avoid ending a writing session at a clean break point between steps_. E.g. if I brain dump my thoughts in a given writing session, I'll quickly throw a few quotes into a new document before wrapping up, and pick up there the next day. If I write an outline in a given session, I'll write the first paragraph or two in that outline in the same session.

**Todo: add graph**

The purpose here is to avoid aligning the beginning of each step--which has mental high activation energy---with the beginning of a writing session---where my momentum is lowest. Instead, by tackling the beginning of each step at the end of a writing session, I can align high-activation energy points in the process with the times when I have _high_ momentum. Additionally, the [Zeigarnik effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect), which says that uncompleted things stick in the mind more durably than completed ones, will help me thread each session into the next one and keep the mental loop open.

**TODO: discuss innerhelm preview site / SDT?

## Conclusion

**TODO: continue from here**

I think if I can try to do (part of) one of those steps each morning as I write I could probably turn out essays at a better pace than I have so far. Although the first point should probably be done ad-hoc, maybe framed as a hypothesis in my Obsidian workspace (rather than in a daily note or something).

One thing I like about this process is that I have three low-friction early ejection points (I could ship what I have after steps 1, 4, or 5, if I wanted to) and two higher-friction points (I could write a simple essay based on what I have after step 2 or 3).

Another way to think about this, which I might adopt because it's lower in activation energy, is to think about each step (combining steps 2-4 into one step, and steps 5-6 into one step) as an optional level up in thoroughness:
1. Written
2. Written based on an outline
3. Written based on an outline and reviewed by others
Some writing—such as [my post about my linkblog](/posts/linkblog), or this post—only deserves to be a 1.

Been thinking a lot about how [this thread](https://chat.mercerfamily.page/mercer-family/pl/w91gonurr7dg8ezagscs6sne8r) connects to Innerhelm over the last week. (TL;DR my high-stress, high-procrastination writing style in college poisoned my relationship to writing.) I've had some interesting thoughts about what makes my relationship to code different, how those ideas relate to my core motivations (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), and how I can leverage those things to heal the poisoning:
* I break coding tasks into bite-sized subtasks, using my subtasks-heavy loosely ordered list approach in Todoist, as [mentioned previously](https://chat.mercerfamily.page/mercer-family/pl/7os4tsuh67nd7rqzsaddbmte4w). This lowers the difficulty of (1) knowing what to do for a specific top-level task and (2) deciding which task to work on, while still preserving my autonomy. And overall, the Todoist approach I use feels highly autonomous because I can quickly demote and promote various tasks as my thinking about the project changes.
* I have something _showable_ quickly when I code. In part, this flows out of the nature of coding (especially UI coding), but it's also related to the above point; small atomic subtasks usually result in demonstrable increments in what I'm building, even within the space of an hour or two in the morning. I often find myself wrapping up my morning coding and then going to show Eve what I've changed. Even if it's something small (like adding the rename-collision functionality in Logwise yesterday), the fact that I can say "look what I did!" gives me a satisfying competence and relatedness hit.

So I need to bring those two things into my Innerhelm work, and do so in a way that avoids the panic-stress my brain associates with writing, so I can show my brain that writing is actually fun:
* I've reorganized my Innerhelm writing project, and it's working ok so far, but I realized I also need to put "bugfixes" and other low-hanging fruit into the top-level queue. Things like writing in my daily notes in Journote, writing a practice elevator-pitch for agency thinking (something I'm trying to do repeatedly, to get better at it), etc. I also want to add exploration tasks for exploring questions and ideas, framed as small completable chunks, e.g. "gather a few resources about children and agency thinking" or "write an outline of questions to explore about higher-order-agency". And I think in some cases, lifting these _out_ of their related article task---rendering them as prerequisites rather than as subtasks---can help me knock them off as small atomic chunks.
* Showability is trickier, but I had a thought about it today: I'm gonna make a separate GitHub pipeline that changes whatever draft I last worked on to have a `pubDate` (which makes it included in the build output) and publishes the site to `wip.innerhelm.pages.dev`. Then that site will always have a working draft of whichever post/page I last worked on, which I can show to Eve and others for feedback, validation, and that relatedness/competence hit I get from showing off my code.

We'll see how well it works!
