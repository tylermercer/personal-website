As a lot of people do, I think more about bigger picture goals around the start of the new year. This year I started with some high-level goals, which I have been refining into more concrete plans over the last couple months.

I figured I could benefit from writing out those goals and plans here, both as a sort of declaration of intent (and a commitment pact, like ["Unlaunching"](/posts/software/unlaunching/) was) and as a space to reflect.

Here are the goals I'm reaching for this year, and specific things I'm doing to reach for them:

## Be physically healthier

1. **Minimize my intake of refined sugar.** I've done this by setting strict rules for what sugar I _will_ eat, including dark chocolate (at most one square per day), ice cream (at most once per calendar month, and only on a date with my wife), and dried fruit (as much as I want, provided it's unsweetened). It's been helpful to have precise ways in which I can enjoy sugar without giving myself license to eat whatever I want (which did not mix well with working from home, since I would tend to eat whatever sugary snackable foods I could find).
2. **Move more.** I've implemented this by getting a treadmill base for my standing desk. Last December, when I decided to do this, I set up a step-tracking app on my phone, so that I could monitor my step counts before and after getting the treadmill base.

  I also have been tracking in my notes how many hours I walk each day, which has been very helpful. As author Gretchen Rubin writes in _Better Than Before_: "Self-measurement brings self-awareness, and self-awareness strengthens our self-control."

## Be mentally healthier

- **No app-building.** I wrote about the downsides of how app-building interacts with my mind in my post ["Unlaunching"](/posts/software/unlaunching/)—and then, about a month later, proceeded to get briefly swept up in a new app idea. So I decided, with some guidance from the Lord through personal revelation, to set a _bright-line rule_ for myself: no app-building this year. I'm not necessarily ruling out app-building in the future, but for now I want to (1) be more present in my family life, especially as my one-year-old daughter is going through such a fun stage (she's been learning to walk over the last couple weeks!) and (2) write more, especially for _Innerhelm_. (I discussed both these things in "Unlaunching".)
- **Write more.** This is one I've found hard to make quantitative in a comprehensive way. My writing has several facets, including my journaling, my scripture study notes, my notes on my reading and research for _Innerhelm_, my public writing here, and my public writing for _Innerhelm_. Each of those facets is important to me for different reasons, and, to be frank, each of them is at present quite lacking in output. But one sub-goal that I've decided on is to write eight blog posts on _Innerhelm_---each of which should be a 3 on [my writing-thoroughness scale](/posts/degrees-of-thoroughness/). (My writing here is often well-suited to being only a 1 or a 2.)
- **Read more.** Right now, my goal here is to read at least one book a month, though I might increase this as I find a better rhythm for fitting reading into my schedule. I'm considering turning my highlights from these books into highlights-reel-style overviews (like [Nick Wignall did with Anthony de Mello's _Awareness_](https://nickwignall.com/return-to-wonder-a-review-of-awareness-by-anthony-de-mello/)), and publishing them on _Innerhelm_. (At present I'm working my way through Thoreau's _Walden_, which I highly recommend.) I also want to finish all the in-progress books on my list (there are several).

## Stretch in new ways

- **Write more.** The above goal about writing also applies to this category---writing eight level-three posts in a single year is substantially more than I've written before.
- **Become conversant in Spanish.** This one has been very hard to come up with a good system for. I've got the foundations of Spanish in place fairly well---I can typically understand most of what my wife says when talking to her Spanish-speaking friends, for example. But I'm having a hard time developing my ability to formulate sentences at conversational speed. I think I could do it with minimal difficulty if I could live in a Spanish-speaking place for a month or two---immersion learning is a powerful way to learn a language. But that's not really in the cards at the moment, and as such I'm having a hard time creating a good plan to tackle this one.

## Be self-compassionate

With the strict rules and monitoring setups I'm using for the above goals, I'm reminding myself that I need to be extremely self-compassionate. So I'm not labeling myself a worse person if I fail to hit a given standard (such as eating sugary foods that weren't on my allowlist over Valentine's weekend), and I'm not subjecting myself to the tool of psychological torture that is a don't-break-the-chain streak count ([the downsides of which I have written about before](https://innerhelm.com/posts/persistence/)). My goal is rather to keep my standards from dropping over time, even though I intermittently fail to hit them, and monitor the results, so I can see my progress and thus increase my intrinsic motivations of autonomy and competence.

> In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high.
> ~ Henry David Thoreau, _Walden_

I'll do an additional write-up at the end of the year that reflects on how this went, and perhaps reflect back on this in my writing over the course of the year as well.
