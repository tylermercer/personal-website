At the start of last year, I had two side-project goals.

The first was [starting this blog](/posts/obligatory-hello-world/). I haven‚Äôt
been the most frequent or consistent blogger since then, but it‚Äôs been a nice
occasional outlet for my thoughts. I especially enjoyed writing the two
long-form posts I wrote last year:
["Free Lunches in Frontend Dev"](/posts/software/free-lunches/) and ["Certainty
and Uncertainty as Elements of
Faith"](/posts/faith/certainty-and-uncertainty-as-elements-of-faith/). By the
numbers, I‚Äôve written 16,685 words on this blog since it started, and
[16 posts](/posts/)---about 1.5 posts per month on average. (I‚Äôm hoping to write
more frequently this year.)

My second goal was to launch _something_ relating to helping people live
intentionally and meaningfully. I‚Äôve been interested in how software can do that
since 2017, when I decided to add a psychology minor to my computer science
studies at Brigham Young University. This interest has taken me in a few
different directions since then, including a handful of side projects that never
got off the ground, but I wanted this new project to be different. At the
beginning of 2023, my plan was that it would be an opinionated values-based
journaling app with a blog explaining the principles and philosophy behind it,
but as I read more about intentional living last summer, my thinking
crystallized around an interesting concept: _agency thinking_.

I decided to start a blog and newsletter, which I‚Äôve named
[Innerhelm](https://innerhelm.com), to explore agency thinking further. (I got
the landing page and subscription form up on December 30th---accomplishing my
goal of launching in 2023. üòÖ)

Innerhelm‚Äôs goal, as stated on its landing page, is to find answers to this
question:

> **How can agency thinking be cultivated in oneself and in others?**

If this concept and question are interesting to you, please consider
[subscribing](https://innerhelm.com/#newsletter)! You can also check out the
newsletters I‚Äôve sent so far:

1. [Sincerity, growth, and hope](https://innerhelm.com/newsletters/sincerity-growth-and-hope/)
2. [A history and a hypothesis](https://innerhelm.com/newsletters/a-history-and-a-hypothesis/)
3. [Why ‚Äúagency thinking‚Äù?](https://innerhelm.com/newsletters/why-agency-thinking/)

Additionally, I‚Äôve written a post on the Innerhelm blog capturing
[the journey that led me to start this project](https://innerhelm.com/posts/where-innerhelm-began/).
