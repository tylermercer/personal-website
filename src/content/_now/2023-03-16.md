I am currently working at Brevium, where I collaborate with some amazing people
and use ASP.NET, Blazor, HTML, Typescript, Tailwind, WPF, and Microsoft SQL Server. I
manage the code side of Brevium’s budding design system.

Outside of work, I’ve been doing a lot with 11ty, Astro, CUBE CSS, Solid, Supabase,
Fauna, and Cloudflare Workers.

I’ve also been reading _The Gifts of Imperfection_
by Brene Brown with my wife Evelyn, and just finished _Indistractible_ by Nir
Eyal.[^distracted] I highly recommend both books.

[^distracted]: I started _Indistractible_ a while ago and got most of the way through
it, but finally picked it up again a few weeks ago. You could say I got
distracted.
