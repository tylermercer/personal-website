I'm currently working as a software engineer at Brevium, where I collaborate
with some amazing people and use ASP.NET, Blazor, HTML, Typescript, Tailwind,
WPF, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Outside of work, I've been doing a lot with Astro, Preact, Convex, and
Cloudflare lately.

I've also read several books recently:

* _How We Change (And Ten Reasons Why We Don't)_ by Ross Ellenhorn
* _Digital Minimalism_ by Cal Newport
* _Drive_ by Daniel H. Pink
* _Essentialism_ by Greg McKeown
* _The Power of Positive Thinking_ by Norman Vincent Peale
* _Better Than Before_ by Gretchen Rubin

(This list deserves a more detailed discussion in a post of its own, which I
will post sometime soon.)
