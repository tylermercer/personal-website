I'm currently working as a senior software engineer at
[Lucid](https://lucid.co/). The opinions and views expressed on this site are my
own and don’t necessarily reflect those of Lucid.

Outside of work, I've been doing a lot with Astro, SvelteKit, and
Cloudflare lately.

I've just started reading
[_Better Onboarding_ by Krystal Higgins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195261600X?psc=1&smid=A3IHWHW38Z0N1B&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp).

<summary><strong>What's this?</strong></summary>

The /now page movement was started by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff). From [the page he created to explain it](https://nownownow.com/about):

> Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
> ...
> So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
> ... **Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.** ... That's what a now page is for.
