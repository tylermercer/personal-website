import metadata from '../../utils/metadata';

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and hosted on
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Some other resources I used as part of this site:

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.
* [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org) for self-hosting the two webfonts:
  * [Figtree](https://www.erikdkennedy.com/projects/figtree.html), designed by
    by [Erik Kennedy](https://www.erikdkennedy.com/)
  * [Faustina](https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/faustina/), designed by
    Alfonso Garcia and [Omnibus-Type](https://www.omnibus-type.com/)
* [Cloudflare Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/)
  for simple, privacy-preserving analytics.

I deploy the site via a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site daily and
deploys it to Cloudflare.

_Last deployed on { metadata.builtAt }._
