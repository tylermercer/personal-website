A talk by C.S. Lewis about the dangers of seeking to be part of an exclusive group (at work, but I think it applies in other domains too). I like his antidote:

> If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it.
