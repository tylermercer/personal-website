Some good thoughts on the value of blogging. I liked this bit: 

> Your GitHub profile shows your contributions to open source and lets people know how well you can code. But your blog shows your contributions to knowledge, and shows how well you can think. That's valuable!

Another point I'd add is that blogging constitutes a decentralized, global conversation that can yield new connections---both between ideas and between people. As [David Perrell (used to?) put it](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/02/24/day-and-night-your-content-searches-the-world-for-people-and-opportunities/) in ["The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online"](https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online/):

> Content builds on itself. It multiplies and compounds. Day and night, your content searches the world for people and opportunities.
