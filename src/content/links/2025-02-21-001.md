Readwise's streak-recovery feature is such an awesome solution to [the downsides of streaks](https://innerhelm.com/posts/persistence/#the-pitfalls-of-consistency).

I'm reminded of a quote from James Clear's _Atomic Habits_:

> Missing once is a mistake. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

Being able to recover a streak seems like a good way to disincentivize "missing twice."
