title: A Simple Tactic For Progressively-Enhanced Search

This post by Jim Nielsen describes a simple but clever (the good clever this
time!) approach to implementing a progressively enhanced search on a website: in
the no-JS case, the search form submits via a GET request to your search engine
of choice, with the search input mapped to the `q` parameter. E.g. with DuckDuckGo:

```html
<form method="get" action="https://www.duckduckgo.com/">
  <input type="text" id="search" name="q" />
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
```

Then when JS loads you could use something like [PageFind](https://pagefind.app/)
for a more interactive on-site experience. Might have to try this on my personal site.
