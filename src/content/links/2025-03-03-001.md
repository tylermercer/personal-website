The intro to a book by J.W. Richey that intentionally leans into the "This book should have been a blog post" trope, by providing a "chapter zero" that is the blog post version, and then expounding the ideas further in subsequent blog-post-like chapters. I've seen this pattern in other books (_Extreme Ownership_, _Indistractible_, _Essentialism_, and _Deploy Empathy_ all seem to fit the mold, to varying degrees). I think it usually works pretty well for nonfiction. And it seems like it could be a natural extension of [my writing process](/posts/degrees-of-thoroughness/) if I ever decide to write a book.
