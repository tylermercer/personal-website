An interesting post arguing that uncomfortable emotions like despair can increase productivity for software engineers if they escape those emotions by getting into flow. I think that might be true, at least in some cases, but I don't think it's a healthy way to approach work. It reminds me of [the quasi-addicted state](/posts/software/unlaunching) I found myself in when building Logwise: productive, but self-diminishing. Companies don't need more reasons to put employee productivity over employee well-being.
