I thought this was neat. Might need to get an iPhone! But maybe I’ll try
[this Android app providing similar functionality](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.kinestop)
and see if it works for me; apparently the individual differences in the
effectiveness of a visual-cues solution like this
[are quite large](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dcxt65/comment/l81xezu/),
and even a slight lag in the software could
[make symptoms worse](https://www.self.com/story/vehicle-motion-cues-review).

(I didn’t get motion sickness at all until getting it quite suddenly a couple
years ago. Since then I have to be very careful to avoid using my phone in the
car. I’m not sure what the change was.)
