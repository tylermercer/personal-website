An interesting and relatable read about someone's experience being diagnosed
with and learning about ADHD. This statistic about untreated ADHD's impact on
life expectancy was startling:

> **A 2015 Lancet study found that people with untreated ADHD die, on average,
> 9.5 years earlier than their peers.** Not from the condition itself, but from
> its cascade of negative effects: accidents, impulsive decisions, and
> self-medication.

I recently read a book called
[_ADHD 2.0_](https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-2-0-Essential-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0399178740)
that provided a neat and accessible explanation of our modern understanding of
ADHD and how it works. (Or, more accurately, I started reading it, only to get
distracted and not finish it before the Libby loan I had ran out, which is
painfully ironic. ðŸ˜‚) I highly recommend reading it for anyone who has ADHD
themselves or spends a lot of time with someone who has it.
