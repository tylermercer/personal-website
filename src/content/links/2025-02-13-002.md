I liked these thoughts by Henrik Karlsson (who
[I've quoted before](/posts/software/unlaunching)). He writes about having an
"anxious narrator" part of his mind, and explains how he deals with it. I won't
quote it here---it's a handful of paragraphs long, and an excerpt won't do the
whole passage justice---but it's worth a read.
