Whoa neatâ€”a new `moveBefore` DOM manipulation method that preserves state. E.g.
iframes can be moved without reloading them, inputs can be moved without losing
focus. Could be very interesting to combine with the same-document [View
Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API).
