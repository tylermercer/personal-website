I'm currently working as a software engineer at Brevium, where I collaborate
with some amazing people and use ASP.NET, Blazor, HTML, Typescript, Tailwind,
WPF, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Outside of work, I've been doing a lot with Astro, Preact, Convex, and
Cloudflare lately.

I've also read several books recently:

* _How We Change (And Ten Reasons Why We Don't)_ by Ross Ellenhorn
* _Digital Minimalism_ by Cal Newport
* _Drive_ by Daniel H. Pink
* _Essentialism_ by Greg McKeown
* _The Power of Positive Thinking_ by Norman Vincent Peale
* _Better Than Before_ by Gretchen Rubin

(This list deserves a more detailed discussion in a post of its own, which I
will post sometime soon.)

<summary><strong>What's this?</strong></summary>

The /now page movement was started by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff). From [the page he created to explain it](https://nownownow.com/about):

> Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
> ...
> So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
> ... **Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.** ... That's what a now page is for.
