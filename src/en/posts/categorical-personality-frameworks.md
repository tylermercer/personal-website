(Spicy take alert üå∂Ô∏è)

I despise categorical personality frameworks.

Today I was listening to _Better Than Before_ by Gretchen Rubin (creator of the Four Tendencies personality framework)
and I realized why:

**They are a lossy compression algorithm for the complexity of human experience.**

(Think of a JPEG image and how they look lower quality than a PNG. That's lossy compression.)

Categorical personality frameworks claim to be simply categorizing people, but there's an inherent loss of detail when
you do that. For example, in her book, Rubin says Questioners often hate waiting in lines. That's illogical to me,
even though I am (according to her framework) a Questioner. Thus, if she met me and learned that I am a Questioner,
she would have baseline assumptions about me ("oh he must dislike waiting in lines") that are simply not
true.

In other words, the Four Tendencies (and any categorical personality
test, e.g. Meyers-Briggs) is an attempt to abstract away the complexity inherent in being human. It's a
reductionistic (and I would argue _unhelpfully_ reductionistic) caricature of reality.

Admittedly, having false assumptions about a person is certainly not only caused by categorical personality frameworks.
But it is, arguably, almost always caused by categorical _thinking_, of which categorical personality frameworks are a type.

Furthermore:

* These frameworks claim to be scientific but don't hold water under scientific scrutiny.
* These frameworks' test results sound plausible because of [the Barnum-Forer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect), and by
  doing so can actively lead a person _away_ from genuine self-knowledge.
* Categorization increases division and incites conflict among people. This is called
  [minimal group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_group_paradigm)---simply being divided into
  groups is enough for people to start disliking the other group(s) and favoring their own.

(So far, _Better Than Before_ has been interesting and worth the read. It's just the part about the "law" (ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) of the Four Tendencies
that irritates me.)

And for anyone who reads this and says "wow you're such a Questioner":  that's called
[begging the question](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question). üôÇ
