In 1687, Isaac Newton published _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_,
in which he laid out groundbreaking new ideas about the physics of movement. The
_Principia_ was so thorough and rigorous that it has been described as "the
ultimate exemplar of science generally."^[G. E. Smith, "Newton's Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia Mathematica", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
(Winter 2008 Edition), E. N. Zalta (ed.).] It expounds laws of motion and
physics that are universally
applicable.^[["Isaac Newton - Wikipedia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton)]

...except for things travelling at speeds near the speed of light. This is what
Eintstein posited with his famous Theory of Special Relativity, which he first
described in a 1905 paper entitled "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the
Electrodynamics of Moving
Bodies").^[["Albert Einstein - Wikipedia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)]

Was Newton _wrong_? No. But his writing was reductionistic. It didn't capture
the special scenarios later discussed by Einstein. It reduced a complex reality
to a usefully simpler set of concepts that was easier to comprehend. Newton
didn't know this, of course---he didn't know about special relativity. He wrote
about what he _did_ know, and the result was increased understanding and
scientific progress, notwithstanding it being reductionistic.

When you think about it, _all_ writing is reductionistic. Writing is our human
attempt to capture what is probably an infinitely complex reality in finitely
complex words. Thus, our writing is necessarily incomplete, lacking detail.

It's kind of like tracing a fractal---a mathematical shape with infinite
detail---with a finite pen. It can't be done. That's not to say that you can't
achieve a meaningful or useful approximation of the fractal, though. With
writing it is the same.
