title: Certainty and Uncertainty as Elements of Faith

Something I've been thinking about and have been encountering in the scriptures
and elsewhere lately is how true faith requires us to _embrace_ uncertainty,
when we often want to reject it.

It started with the _Come, Follow Me_ study guide from a few weeks
back,^[Specifically, [the week on Matthew 8, Mark 2–4, and Luke 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-new-testament-2023/10?lang=eng)]
which referenced
["Accepting the Lord's Will and Timing"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2016/08/accepting-the-lords-will-and-timing?lang=eng),
an article by Elder David A. Bednar. In the article, Elder Bednar tells a
heart-wrenching story of a newly-married young man who was diagnosed with
cancer. He asked Elder Bednar to give him a blessing.^[In the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-Day Saints, blessings are given by the authority of the God
(called the priesthood), for purposes of healing the sick or providing counsel
or comfort. These blessings are typically given at the request of the person in
need, and are given by the laying on of hands, as described in the Bible (e.g.
in
[Mark 16:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16?lang=eng&id=17-18#p17)
and
[Acts 28:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/28.8?lang=eng#p8)).

**_TODO: Summarize_**

A day or two later, my wife and I came across this quote from theologian
Richard Rohr:^[ Quoted by Brené Brown in _The Gifts of Imperfection_ ]

> My scientist friends have come up with things like ‘principles of uncertainty’
> and dark holes. They’re willing to live inside imagined hypotheses and
> theories. But many religious folks insist on answers that are always true. We
> love closure, resolution and clarity, while thinking that we are people of
> ‘faith’! How strange that the very word ‘faith’ has come to mean its exact
> opposite.

Since then, that idea of "faith to embrace uncertainty" seems to be popping up
everywhere. Like Hebrews 11:13-16:

> 13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen
> them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed
> that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
>
> 14 For they that say such
> things declare plainly that they seek a country.
>
> 15 And truly, if they had
> been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had
> opportunity to have returned.
>
> 16 But now they desire a better country, that
> is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
> hath prepared for them a city.

And the other day I was pondering Alma 26:22, which was quoted a lot on my mission:

> 22 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works,
> and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the
> mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which
> never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring
> thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring
> these our brethren to repentance

On the mission it was referred to almost as a sort of "recipe"---if you do these
things you _will_ baptize converts. But when I pondered that in the context of
"faith to embrace uncertainty," I realized something interesting:
[Enos](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng)
(one of the authors of the Book of Mormon) also did all of the things mentioned
in that verse^[ Repent and exercise faith:
[The book of Enos, verses 1-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p8#p1).
Do good works:
[verses 19-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19).
Pray continually, earnestly, and with sincerity:
[verses 1-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p18#p1).]
but he specifically says they were _unsuccessful_ in their attempts to teach the
then-unbelieving
Lamanites.^[[Verse 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20):
"But our labors were vain"]

I think the problem is that we impose our own ideas about how and when the Lord
fulfills His promises. Instead, we need to have faith to embrace uncertainty.
That's what enabled Enos to keep going even when unsuccessful. I'm sure Satan
wanted him to doubt himself, but he was able to say, "I know God will eventually
redeem the Lamanites, but I don't know when or how, and that's ok." His faith to
embrace uncertainty was what let him press forward.

Now, there _is_ an element of certainty to faith. Alma says "if ye have faith,
ye hope for that which is not seen, which is true." There must be some true idea
in which we believe in order for us to have faith. But that's exactly where
rejecting uncertainty undermines our faith: rejecting uncertainty leads us to
hold _false_ beliefs, like "if I do the things in Alma 26:22 then I _will_
baptize people on my mission." You can't have effectual faith by believing
something that's false. As Bruce R. McConkie put it, "there is no power in
believing a false doctrine." Such belief is inert, and often a stumbling block.

Thus, we need to cultivate both the willingness to admit what we do not
know---what is sometimes called epistemic humility---and the courage to hold
firm convictions in what we do know. Jacob Hess discusses the need to balance
these two ideas in
[this excellent article in Public Square Magazine](https://publicsquaremag.org/faith/gospel-fare/conviction-is-no-sin/).

Hess mentions "epistemic humility as a barrier to new knowledge," or, in other
words, being too certain that something is uncertain and not seeking further
light. Certainly, this is something we should be wary of. The balance between
certainty and uncertainty is a very nuanced one (as discussed in that article).

However, particularly when it comes to how things will happen in the future, I
believe that, in many cases, the way the Lord reveals additional knowledge is by
allowing us to simply witness His will as events proceed, rather than revealing
what will happen in detail to us beforehand. Desiring that the future be
revealed to us "up front" can too easily become a stipulation on our continued
faithful action. This is, ironically, a position of doubt:

> [W]hen people doubt their beliefs, they often suspend their commitment to
> commandments and covenants while waiting for answers. The doubter’s posture is
> generally to withhold obedience or limit it, pending resolution of the doubts.
>
> ...
>
> [A key] problem with doubt is the intent to obey only _after_ the uncertainty
> is resolved to the satisfaction of the
> doubter.^[["When Doubts and Questions Arise,"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2015/03/when-doubts-and-questions-arise?lang=eng)
> March
2015 Ensign]

As such, while we should seek knowledge, we should be open to that knowledge
coming through experience rather than through a priori revelation.

## An Example

This exploration of uncertainty as an element of faith was brought about by a
deeply personal experience.
