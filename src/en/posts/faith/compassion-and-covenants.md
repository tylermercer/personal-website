I once heard someone say that
[Alma 53:10-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p10-p15#p10)
shows that keeping our
covenants^[[Covenants](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/covenant?lang=eng)
are agreements made with God, on terms set forth by Him in His love and mercy.
We promise to live certain laws, and He promises blessings and grace (strength
to help us live those laws) in return for our earnest effort.] supersedes having
compassion. In those verses, Helaman and the Nephites dissuade the People of
Ammon from going to battle to protect the Nephites, because the People of Ammon
had covenanted with God not to take up arms.

I believe this covenants-over-compassion interpretation is a dangerous idea
resulting from taking an isolated incident out of context and misunderstanding
the nature of compassion and our covenants.

The danger inherent in this idea is that of claiming that our covenants justify
_not_ having compassion. A lack of compassion---and sanctimonious justification
of their callousness---was the sin of the Pharisees, whom Jesus called "whited
sepulchres" for their unwillingness to exercise compassion for those they deemed
to be sinful. From
[Matthew 23:23-27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng&id=p23-p27#p23):

> **23** Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of
> mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier _matters_ of the
> law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave
> the other undone.
>
> **24** _Ye_ blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and
> swallow a camel.
>
> **25** Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the
> outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion
> and excess.
>
> **26** _Thou_ blind Pharisee, cleanse first that _which is_ within the cup and
> platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
>
> **27** Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto
> whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full
> of dead _menâ€™s_ bones, and of all uncleanness.

In actuality, our covenants, when lived fully, _demand_ compassion of us.
Furthermore, in the case of the People of Ammon, the compassion they
demonstrated was a direct result of the conversion that had led them to make
their covenant in the first place! Compassion is an attribute of Jesus Christ.
Any time we seek to justify not having compassion, we are keeping ourselves back
from becoming like Him.

Elder Ulisses Soares emphasized this point in
[his talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/43soares?lang=eng)
from last General Conference:

> One of the most evident signs that we are drawing closer to the Savior and
> becoming more like Him is the loving, patient, and kind way with which we
> treat our fellow beings, whatever the circumstances.

If anything, the story of the tension between the compassion and covenants of
the People of Ammon teaches us that covenant life is messy. We need to be
willing to love others _and_ love God even when doing both is uncomfortable. We
can live in accordance with our covenants and still acknowledge and validate the
experiences, trials, and struggles of those around us. We can still feel a deep
desire to help others even when---for whatever reason---we are unable to help
them. In a way, this discomfort proves that our love is real, and gives it depth
and substance. This principle was exemplified by God Himself in the book of
Moses, when He wept because of the suffering His children had brought upon
themselves and each
other.^[See [Moses 7:28-37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p28-p37#p28).
See also _The God Who Weeps_ by Terryl and Fiona Givens. Quoting from that book:
"It is not their wickedness, but their 'misery,' not their disobedience, but
their 'suffering,' that elicits the God of Heaven's tears."] God, a perfect
being, was willing to experience emotional pain---vulnerability---because of His
love for His children.

We should never use our covenants to justify callousness. True covenant-keeping
includes loving others wholeheartedly and vulnerably---even those who disagree
with us or do not support our ideals.
