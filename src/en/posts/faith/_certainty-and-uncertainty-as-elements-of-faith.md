A month and a half ago, my wife Evelyn and I had a miscarriage scare.

After trying to conceive for about ten months, during which time we had already
had one miscarriage, we were finally pregnant. We saw it as a blessing from God,
and had rejoiced in His answer to our prayers. But now, everything was uncertain
and unclear.

Three months prior, my wife and I were grappling with the uncertainty of
fertility treatments. What if they did not work? What about the side
effects---which could affect both my wife and our future children? What if we
ended up needing to adopt? How would we afford it? When should we decide to
focus on adoption instead of fertility treatments?

Above all, what about the promises the Lord had made to us? Both of our
patriarchal blessings^[ A
[patriarchal blessing](https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/faq/library/patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng)
is a blessing, or inspired declaration, given to each worthy member of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by the authority of the God (called
the priesthood). A patriarchal blessing typically includes statements about a
person's future spiritual experiences, as well as providing insight into the
person's spiritual gifts (attributes such as faith or wisdom, given to a person
to benefit others) and declaring their lineage among the descendants of one of
the twelve sons of the biblical Israel. ] mention us having children, and in the
covenant^[A covenant is a two-way promise between God and a human or humans,
with conditions set forth by Him in His love and mercy.] given to Abraham,^[ See
"[Abrahamic Covenant](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/abrahamic-covenant?lang=eng)"
] we are promised posterity.^[ See
[Gen. 17:5-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/17?lang=eng&id=5-7#p5).
God made this covenant with Abraham and with "[his] seed after [him] in their
generations for an everlasting covenant," covenanting that "[God] will make
[them] exceeding fruitful, and nations shall come out of [them]".] We believed
that God would bless us with children. But I began to wonder if my faith was
insufficient. There are many scriptures that connect miracles with faith.
For example,
[chapter 12 of the book of Ether](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng)
contains the following promises:

> **9** Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye
> will but have faith.

> **16** Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by faith, even
> those who were before Christ and also those who were after.

> **18** And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith;
> wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.

> **29** ... O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest
> unto the children of men according to their faith;

Perhaps, I reasoned, I could receive this blessing if I would just believe
_firmly enough_. But I found my faith and hope fluctuating over time. Sometimes
it was easy to have faith that the Lord would bless us with children, and other
times it was much harder. I became frustrated with myself for what seemed like
an inability to exert more faith.[^faith-and-hope]

## Faith to Accept Uncertainty

Around the time we were grappling with these concerns, my wife and I read
["Accepting the Lord's Will and Timing"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2016/08/accepting-the-lords-will-and-timing?lang=eng),
an article by Elder David A. Bednar.^[ We came across this article through the
[_Come, Follow Me_ study guide for Matthew 8, Mark 2–4, and Luke 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-new-testament-2023/10?lang=eng)
] This article started a journey of discovery for us through which we learned
that we had been thinking about faith the wrong way.

In the article, Elder Bednar tells a heart-wrenching story of a newly-married
young man named John, who was diagnosed with cancer. He asked Elder Bednar to
give him a blessing.^[In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
blessings are often given for purposes of healing the sick or providing counsel
or comfort. These blessings are typically given at the request of the person in
need, and are given by the laying on of hands, as described in the Bible (e.g.
in
[Mark 16:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16?lang=eng&id=17-18#p17)
and
[Acts 28:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/28.8?lang=eng#p8)).
] As Elder Bednar talked with him, he felt inspired to ask John an unexpected
question:

> “John, do you have the faith not to be healed? If it is the will of our
> Heavenly Father that you are transferred by death in your youth to the spirit
> world to continue your ministry, do you have the faith to submit to His will
> and not be healed?”

Elder Bednar explains:

> Frequently in the scriptures, the Savior or His servants
> exercised the spiritual gift of healing and perceived that an individual had
> the faith to be healed. But as John and Heather and I counseled together and
> wrestled with these questions, we increasingly understood that if God’s will
> were for this good young man to be healed, then that blessing could be
> received only if this valiant couple first had the faith not to be healed. In
> other words, John and Heather needed to overcome, through the Atonement of the
> Lord Jesus Christ, the “natural man”
> ([Mosiah 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19))
> tendency in all of us to demand impatiently and insist incessantly on the
> blessings we want and believe we deserve.

Certainly (and gratefully!), neither Evelyn nor I had cancer, but our situation
was nonetheless similar in kind, if not in extremity. We recognized that we,
like them, needed to have the faith not to receive our desired blessing.

Later that week, we read part of _The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Brené Brown, and
came to the section on faith. In it, Brown quotes theologian Richard Rohr:

> My scientist friends have come up with things like ‘principles of uncertainty’
> and dark holes. They’re willing to live inside imagined hypotheses and
> theories. But many religious folks insist on answers that are always true. We
> love closure, resolution and clarity, while thinking that we are people of
> ‘faith’! How strange that the very word ‘faith’ has come to mean its exact
> opposite.

That was the kind of faith John and Heather had had to exercise. Faith to
accept, acknowledge, and perhaps even embrace uncertainty.

As I've pondered and studied that idea since then, I've encountered it
everywhere, such as in
[Hebrews 11:13-16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p13-p16#p13):

> **13** These [the individuals Paul mentions in the preceding verses] all died in
> faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and
> were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were
> strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
>
> **14** For they that say such
> things declare plainly that they seek a country.
>
> **15** And truly, if they had
> been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had
> opportunity to have returned.
>
> **16** But now they desire a better country, that
> is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
> hath prepared for them a city.

The people Paul speaks of in this scripture faced uncertainty about both _when_
and _how_ the Lord would fulfill His promises to them.

A few days later, I was reminded of
[Alma 26:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p22#p22),
which was quoted often by my leaders on my mission:

> **22** Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works,
> and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the
> mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which
> never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring
> thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring
> these our brethren to repentance

On my mission, this scripture was interpreted almost as a sort of "recipe"---if
you do these things you _will_ baptize converts. But when I considered it in the
context of "faith to accept uncertainty," I realized something interesting:
Enos^[One of the authors of the Book of Mormon, who wrote
[one powerful and well-known chapter](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng)]
_also_ did all of the things mentioned in that verse:

* Repent and exercise faith:
  [verses 1-8 of his record](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p8#p1).
* Do good works:
  [verses 19-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19).
* Pray continually, earnestly, and with sincerity:
  [verses 1-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p18#p1).

However, Enos specifically says he and his fellow missionaries were
_unsuccessful_ in their attempts to teach the then-unbelieving
Lamanites.^[[Verse 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20):
"But our labors were vain"] The promise in Alma 26 wasn't fulfilled for Enos
until 330 years later (which, ironically, was the occasion for the great teacher
Ammon uttering the words previously quoted from Alma 26). Clearly, there is
uncertainty about how and when this promise is fulfilled.

## Certainty and Uncertainty

As I continued pondering and studying this idea, I learned that effectual faith
involves both certainty and uncertainty. This can be seen in
[Alma 32:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p21#p21):

> And now as I said concerning faith---faith is not to have a perfect knowledge
> of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen,
> which are true.

There must be some true idea in which we believe in order for us to have faith.
But that's exactly where rejecting uncertainty undermines our faith: rejecting
uncertainty leads us to hold _false_ beliefs, like "if I do the things in Alma
26:22 then I _will_ baptize people on my mission." I learned that you can't have
effectual faith by believing something that's false.

To see why false certainty is a hindrance, I found it helpful to examine
knowledge, faith, and false certainty using the _justified true belief_ (JTB)
model of knowledge. These three qualities---truth, belief of that truth, and
justification of that belief---are necessary components of knowledge.

If knowledge is _justified_ true belief, faith is, inherently, _unjustified_
true belief. This can be seen in the verse from Alma 32 quoted earlier---faith
is a belief in "things which are not seen," or, in other words, not justified.
If truth, belief, and justification are necessary components of knowledge, then
truth, belief, and _a lack of justification_ are equally necessary components of
faith. As Alma says in the same chapter: "if a man knoweth a thing he hath no
cause to believe [meaning no cause to exert faith], for he knoweth it."

The third case, false certainty, is unjustified _false_ belief. We assert some
idea that we _think_ is true, but is not. A good scriptural example of this is
seen in the Pharisees, who held several beliefs about the Messiah, such as "the
Messiah will destroy the Romans" and "the Messiah will respect our religious
authority." Because what they saw in Jesus contradicted these false beliefs, the
Pharisees rejected Him as the Messiah.

I learned that I needed to cultivate both the willingness to admit what I did
not know and the courage to firmly believe in what God had promised. The
interaction between these two seemingly-opposed ideas is a delicate one, of the
kind that Ross Ellenhorn refers to as a _both-and
proposition_,^[[_How We Change (And Ten Reasons Why We Don't)_](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/how-we-change-ross-ellenhorn)]
as opposed to an either-or proposition. I needed _both_ firm belief _and_ the
ability to acknowledge uncertainty if I was to have effectual faith in the Lord
and His promises.

## Balancing Conviction and Epistemic Humility

Jacob Z. Hess discusses these two concepts---conviction and uncertainty---in
[this excellent article in Public Square Magazine](https://publicsquaremag.org/faith/gospel-fare/conviction-is-no-sin/).
He specifically responds to the zeitgeist of "certainty bad, uncertainty good"
that can be seen in a lot of recent faith discussions. Arguing that this stance
often conflates conviction with dogmatism, he encourages us to value conviction
while recognizing uncertainty. He warns against the harmful reductionism of
"those who either demonize doubt without conditions or who glorify doubt as an
unmistakable sign of greater enlightenment":

> In the same moment that we hold space for uncertainty, therefore, let’s not
> overly valorize doubt in a way that obscures its potential dangers.

Instead, he argues, we should "[aspire] for humility instead of uncertainty"---a
humility that enables a person to both acknowledge what she or he does not know,
and at the same time to seek further light from God.

Along the same lines, he mentions the danger of "epistemic humility as a barrier
to new knowledge," or, in other words, being too certain that something is
_uncertain_ and not seeking further light:

> [I]t’s widely appreciated how epistemic humility can catalyze our learning, as
> we are open to truth and welcoming of uncertainty, etc. But when taken to an
> extreme, can these same sensibilities undermine and erode our growth in
> spiritual knowledge? ...
>
> More specifically, can an _a priori_ aversion to any degree of certainty (or
> strong conviction) prevent people from ever seeking more direct reassurance,
> more definitive experiences, and more final and grounding forms of knowing?
> And in this way, can an overemphasis on uncertainty ultimately trip us up?

These are thought provoking questions. I think they are especially relevant to
uncertainty that does not pertain to the fulfilment of God's promises in the
future. For example, many people face uncertainties about how to harmonize or
reconcile certain aspects of religion and science or history, and some choose to
put these uncertainties on a metaphorical "shelf" for later resolution. While
this shelf idea is useful, it is equally useful to instead take God at His word
when He says "if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
men [and women] liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given
him."^[[James
1:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)]
This is particularly true in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints---one of our fundamental tenets is that the heavens are not closed. To
quote
[Doctrine & Covenants 121:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p33#p33):

> What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny
> arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream,
> as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the
> heads of the Latter-day Saints.

## When Uncertainty is Still Valuable

However, when it comes to how things will happen in the future, I've come to
believe that the Lord often reveals additional knowledge to us by allowing us to
simply witness His will as events proceed, rather than revealing what will
happen in detail to us beforehand. Our desiring that the future be revealed to
us "up front" can easily become a stipulation on our continued faithful action.
This is, ironically, a mindset of
doubt:^[["When Doubts and Questions Arise,"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2015/03/when-doubts-and-questions-arise?lang=eng)
March 2015 Ensign]

> [W]hen people doubt their beliefs, they often suspend their commitment to
> commandments and covenants while waiting for answers. The doubter’s posture is
> generally to withhold obedience or limit it, pending resolution of the doubts.
> ...
>
> [A key] problem with doubt is the intent to obey only _after_ the uncertainty
> is resolved to the satisfaction of the doubter.

As such, while we should seek knowledge, we should be open to that knowledge
coming through experience rather than in advance through revelation.

False certainty often begins with good intentions, as it did for my wife and
me---we had a righteous desire to be parents, and I in particular attempted to
assert my belief with certainty. "I _know_ that God will bless us with children
at this time and in this way." This kind of firm assertion of certainty feels
like we are choosing to have strong faith. But, as discussed previously, false
certainty and faith have different characteristics---and the most crucial
difference is that false certainty is, well, _false_. Ultimately, when we make
our minds accept as certainty that which is false, we limit ourselves. This
self-limitation happens in at least two ways.

First, we are simply _less capable_ when we are acting upon falsehoods. If, for
example, I buy into "get rich quick" schemes, or prosperity
theology,^[[Prosperity theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology)
is the false belief that material wealth is always the will of God for His
followers.] and make investment decisions based on that false belief, my
financial growth, and my current and future freedom, would be restricted.
Another example is negative stereotypes---if I have false negative beliefs about
a particular group of people, I am likely to judge people from that group
incorrectly, falling into "us-vs-them" thinking. This would prevent me from
forming rewarding relationships with people from that group, would inhibit my
personal growth and learning, and could lead to me being hostile or harmful
towards that group.

Second, holding false beliefs restricts our learning, because our false beliefs
must be displaced by the truth in order for us to accept it, and strongly-held
beliefs do not change easily. Studies have shown that, when faced with new
information that contradicts an existing belief, people experience cognitive
dissonance, and often reject the new information entirely. They may even hold
_more strongly_ to their false beliefs, a phenomenon known as belief
perseverance. Acknowledging what we do not know, and cultivating a mindset of
openness, can mitigate these negative self-limiting effects.

The self-restricting nature of false certainty, over time, can cause spiritual
stagnation and complacency. We may think we've "already heard it all" or that we
know all that we need to about the gospel. When taken to an extreme, it can lead
us to reject God's word and His prophets. The scriptures contain many examples
of this: from the self-assured Pharisees, mentioned previously; to the Nephites
who lived in the time preceding Jesus' visit to the Americas, who relied on
their own wisdom to conclude that "it is not reasonable that such a being as
Christ shall
come."^[[Helaman 16:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)]
Ultimately, of course, these people were proven wrong, their false certainty
shaken by truth with which it was incongruent.

Ironically, a position of false certainty feels secure when we firmly assert our
belief, but, when our experience refutes them, we find that we have built upon a
shaky foundation. The ancient prophet Jacob warned against
this:^[[2 Nephi 28:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)]

> And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry because of the truth
> of God! For behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it with gladness;
> and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.

It's counterintuitive, but false certainty's "sandy" nature means that it's only
through _acknowledging uncertainty_ that we can dig deep enough to reach the
firm, bedrock foundation of Jesus Christ and His
gospel.^[See [Helaman 5:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)]

## Exercising Faith with Humility

The Pharisees' rejection of Christ; the Nephites' dismissal of the coming of
Christ as "unreasonable"; and the anger Jacob mentions in the verse quoted
previously have a common underlying cause: pride. In
[his talk from October 2014](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/10/lord-is-it-i?lang=eng#p1),
Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf explains this connection between pride, uncertainty,
and receiving additional light from God:

> We must approach our Eternal Father with broken hearts and teachable minds. We
> must be willing to learn and to change. ...
>
> Those who do not wish to learn and change probably will not and most likely
> will begin to wonder whether the Church [or the gospel] has anything to offer
> them.

False certainty, as in the case of the Pharisees and the "reasonable" Nephites,
often leads us to this dangerous state of being unwilling to learn and change.

He continues:

> But those who want to improve and progress, those who learn of the Savior and
> desire to be like Him, those who humble themselves as a little child and seek
> to bring their thoughts and actions into harmony with our Father in
> Heaven---they will experience the miracle of the Savior’s Atonement. They will
> surely feel God’s resplendent Spirit. They will taste the indescribable joy
> that is the fruit of a meek and humble heart. They will be blessed with the
> desire and discipline to become true disciples of Jesus Christ.

I find it noteworthy that Elder Uchtdorf mentions _meekness_ in connection to
this kind of humble, growth-oriented faith. This, I believe, is a clue to how we
can avoid building on a sandy foundation of false certainty.

Meekness, according to Elder David A. Bednar, "is a defining attribute of the
Redeemer and is distinguished by righteous responsiveness, willing
submissiveness, and strong
self-restraint."^[["Meek and Lowly in Heart"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/meek-and-lowly-of-heart?lang=eng)]
Each of these characteristics supports our effectual faith, but I think Elder
Uchtdorf's point is that meekness is not just a "nice-to-have" when it comes to
faith. The ancient prophet Mormon seemed to
agree:^[[Moroni 7:42-43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p42-p43#p42),
emphasis mine.]

> 43 And again, behold I say unto you that [someone] **cannot** have faith and
> hope, save [or unless] he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.
>
> 44 If [he is not], his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before
> God, save the meek and lowly in heart;

"Cannot" is more than just "likely won't." Meekness is a necessary part of
faith. I believe this has more to do with the inherent nature of faith than with
God being particular about how we exercise it. Certainly, as the apostle James
wrote, "God resisteth the
proud,"^[[James 4:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/4?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)]
but, perhaps more significantly, _the proud resist God_. When we seek to hold
firmly to something that is not true, in essence demanding that it be true, we
unwittingly fall into pride. Faith, on the other hand, is the meek submission of
our will and mind (wherein we lack justification) to God's will and mind (from
which we learn truth, thus forming the _unjustified true belief_ discussed
earlier). In the words of Jacob:^[[Jacob 4:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)]

> Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from
> his hand.

False certainty seeks to counsel the Lord, to fill in the gaps of what is not
clear. Faith humbly accepts what He promises _and_ what He leaves uncertain
about those promises, asking for---but never demanding---additional light, and
always moving forward with trust in Him.

The more I have pondered these concepts, the more I see them in the scriptures.

Nephi, when asked by an angel whether he knew "the condescension of God",
replied "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the
meaning of all
things."^[[1 Nephi 11:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)]
He acknowledged what he did not know (the condescension of God) while holding to
what _had_ been revealed to him (God's love for His children).

Faith to embrace uncertainty enabled Enos to keep going even when he did not
succeed in preaching the gospel to the Lamanites---when God had directly
promised him that the Lamanites would receive the gospel. He could have doubted
himself or God's promises, but he instead chose to say, "I know God will
eventually redeem the Lamanites, but I don't know when or how, and that's ok."

Even after he had lost his family, his livestock, and his property, Job
faithfully declared, "Though [God] slay me, yet will I trust in
Him."^[[Job 13:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/13?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)]

But the most significant example of meek, submissive faith is found in Jesus
Christ Himself. At the apex of His mortal ministry, when He was about to suffer
the sins, pain, sickness, and sorrows of all
humankind,^[See [Alma 7:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11)]
He deferred humbly to His Father's will and
knowledge:^[[Matt. 26:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26?lang=eng&id=p39#p39).
See also
[Luke 22:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/22?lang=eng&id=p42#p42).]

> O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as
> I will, but as thou wilt.

### A Pattern

We can derive a powerful pattern from these scriptural examples:

> [Statement of uncertainty] but [statement of conviction]

The exact text in each case differs slightly from this form, but we can apply
this pattern in our own lives:

* Someone who seeks to be married but has not received that blessing yet might
  say, "I don't know when or how I will have the opportunity to marry, but I
  know God has promised that 'no blessings will be withheld from His faithful
  Saints.'"^[["Celestial Marriage", by then-Elder Russell M. Nelson](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)]
* Someone who struggles with the Church's former policy of not conferring the
  priesthood upon Black members might say, "I don't know why the Priesthood was
  not given to Blacks for a time in this dispensation, but I know that God
  'denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and
  female.'"^[[2 Ne. 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)]
* Someone in John and Heather's situation, discussed earlier---facing uncertain
  health outcomes and possibly even death---might faithfully declare, "I don't
  know whether I will be healed or not, but I know that 'all things have been
  done in the wisdom of Him who knoweth all things' and that 'there shall be a
  resurrection of the dead, both of the just and
  unjust'"^[[2 Nephi 2:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)]^[[Acts 24:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/24?lang=eng&id=15#p15)]

Importantly, the second clause does not _negate_ the first clause. The unknown
thing is still unknown. Rather, meekly recognizing what we do know _and_ what we
don't know allows us to move forward with faith in Christ. We move forward _even
though_ there are unknowns. This makes our faith much more soul-stretching than
moving foward because the unknowns have been resolved.

## Conclusion

Over the course of our fertility journey, Evelyn and I slowly learned to
exercise this kind of faith---not perfectly, but better, and more intentionally,
than we had before. We learned to let go of false certainty and acknowledge what
we did not know. We did not know whether God would bless us with children at
this time in our lives, but we knew that He had promised us children eventually
(whether in this life or in the eternities) and chose a mindset of celebrating
every small experience in that direction: seeing our friends have children, and
getting to know and care for them; seeing our younger relatives grow and
spending time with them; hearing the (frequent!) baby
blessings^[In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, children are blessed and given their names as a priesthood ordinance, typically by their father. These are unique and powerful spiritual experiences wherein the father follows the direction of the Spirit to bless his child. See ["Naming and Blessing Chilren"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings/naming-and-blessing-children?lang=eng#p4)]
as children were born in our church congregation.

Shortly after we learned my wife was pregnant, I had a distinct impression. I
was pondering what we had learned, and I realized that the "overcoming" of our
trial hadn't happened through receiving the blessing we had sought. It had come
earlier, through the Lord gently instructing us in what it really means to have
faith in Him. We overcame the difficulty of infertility _as soon as_ we chose to
have meek, uncertainty-acknowledging faith in Chirst. Our worry and concerns
were "swallowed up" in peace and trust in Him.

The fear and worry of our fertility journey could be described as a "chronic"
case, and the treatment prescribed by the Great
Physician^[See [Matt. 9:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/9?lang=eng&id=12#p12)]---faith
to accept uncertainty--- was effective. The miscarriage scare, on the other
hand, was "acute." Our fear and worry was gripping. We prayed fervently that
night, pleading with the Lord to protect our child. As we prayed, we felt the
soft guidance of the Spirit reminding us of what we had learned. It was
heart-wrenching, but we told the Lord that we would accept His will, and that we
would trust in His promised blessings even if we did not receive our desired
outcome right now and in this way.

After praying, we felt peace. We hoped that things would be okay but trusted
that God was mindful of us and watching over us and our child, regardless of the
outcome.

Fortunately---and _so_ gratefully!---things did turn out okay. Our baby continued
developing and is growing healthily as I write this. We have since learned that
she's a girl, and feel so much joyful anticipation and so much gratitude for
the Lord's hand in our lives and her life in this way. However, we're also
grateful for the powerful truths we have learned, and for the furnace of
affliction in which the impurities of false certainty were refined out of our
faith. We aren't perfect at avoiding false certainty, by any means. I believe
that the digging out of "sand" in our foundations of faith must be an ongoing
process---learning to distinguish what we can place our faith in from what we
cannot. But we have learned to rely more meekly upon God's grace and mercy,
trusting in His timing and being willing to acknowledge what we do not know.

[^faith-and-hope]:

    This article uses the word _faith_ to capture this idea of belief in
    something that is true but "not seen"
    ([Hebrews 11:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)).
    This is an intentionally
    [reductionistic](https://tylermercer.net/posts/all-writing-is-reductionistic/)
    use of the word. More precisely, this kind of belief has two parts, the
    first of which is faith, and the second of which is _hope_. _Faith_ is a
    firm trust in the efficacy of someone or something (and, in the gospel, this
    Someone is Christ), whereas _hope_ is a firm trust in some future outcome,
    often experienced as a result of having faith.
    [Moroni 7:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=41#p41)
    illustrates this distinction and interconnection between faith and hope:

    > And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall
    > have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his
    > resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your
    > faith in him according to the promise.

    Thus, faith and hope are separate but related parts of this kind of belief.
    For the purposes of this article, however, I will simply use the word
    _faith_ to mean both faith and hope (as do many of the scriptures and
    prophetic writings I will reference).
