A month and a half ago, my wife and I had a miscarriage scare.

After trying to conceive for about ten months, during which time we had already
had one miscarriage, we were finally pregnant. We saw it as a blessing from God,
and had rejoiced in His answer to our prayers. But now, everything was uncertain
and unclear.

Three months prior, my wife and I were grappling with the uncertainty of
fertility treatments. What if they did not work? What about the side
effects---which could affect both my wife and our future children? What if we
ended up needing to adopt? How would we afford it? When should we decide to
focus on adoption instead of fertility treatments?

Above all, what about the promises the Lord had made to us? Both of our
patriarchal blessings^[ A
[patriarchal blessing](https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/faq/library/patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng)
is a blessing, or inspired declaration, given to each worthy member of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by the authority of the God (called
the priesthood). A patriarchal blessing typically includes statements about a
person's future spiritual experiences, as well as providing insight into the
person's spiritual gifts (attributes such as faith or wisdom, given to a person
to benefit others) and declaring their lineage among the descendants of one of
the twelve sons of the biblical Israel. ] mention us having children, and in the
covenant^[A covenant is a two-way promise between God and a human or humans,
with conditions set forth by Him in His love and mercy.] given to Abraham^[ See
"[Abrahamic Covenant](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/abrahamic-covenant?lang=eng)"
], we are promised posterity.^[ See
[Gen. 17:5-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/17?lang=eng&id=5-7#p5).
God made this covenant with Abraham and with "[his] seed after [him] in their
generations for an everlasting covenant," covenanting that "[God] will make
[them] exceeding fruitful, and nations shall come out of [them]".] We believed
that God would bless us with children. But I began to wonder if my faith was
insufficient. There are many many scriptures that connect miracles with faith.
For example,
[chapter 12 of the book of Ether](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng)
contains the following promises:

> **9** Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye
> will but have faith.
>
> ...
>
> **16** Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by faith, even
> those who were before Christ and also those who were after.
>
> ...
>
> **18** And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith;
> wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.
>
> ...
>
> **29** ... O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest
> unto the children of men according to their faith;

Perhaps, I reasoned, I could receive this blessing if I would just believe
_firmly enough_. But I found my faith and hope fluctuating over time. Sometimes
it was easy to have faith that the Lord would bless us with children, and other
times it was much harder. I felt frustrated with myself for what seemed like an
inability to exert more faith.

But then my wife and I read
["Accepting the Lord's Will and Timing"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2016/08/accepting-the-lords-will-and-timing?lang=eng),
an article by Elder David A. Bednar.^[ We came across this article through the
[_Come, Follow Me_ study guide for Matthew 8, Mark 2–4, and Luke 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-new-testament-2023/10?lang=eng)
] This article started a journey of discovery for us through which we learned
that we had been thinking about faith the wrong way.

## Faith to Accept Uncertainty

In the article, Elder Bednar tells a heart-wrenching story of a newly-married
young man named John, who was diagnosed with cancer. He asked Elder Bednar to
give him a blessing.^[In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
blessings are often given for purposes of healing the sick or providing counsel
or comfort. These blessings are typically given at the request of the person in
need, and are given by the laying on of hands, as described in the Bible (e.g.
in
[Mark 16:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16?lang=eng&id=17-18#p17)
and
[Acts 28:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/28.8?lang=eng#p8)).
] As Elder Bednar talked with him, he felt inspired to ask John an unexpected
question:

> “John, do you have the faith not to be healed? If it is the will of our
> Heavenly Father that you are transferred by death in your youth to the spirit
> world to continue your ministry, do you have the faith to submit to His will
> and not be healed?”

Elder Bednar explains:

> Frequently in the scriptures, the Savior or His servants
> exercised the spiritual gift of healing and perceived that an individual had
> the faith to be healed. But as John and Heather and I counseled together and
> wrestled with these questions, we increasingly understood that if God’s will
> were for this good young man to be healed, then that blessing could be
> received only if this valiant couple first had the faith not to be healed. In
> other words, John and Heather needed to overcome, through the Atonement of the
> Lord Jesus Christ, the “natural man”
> ([Mosiah 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19))
> tendency in all of us to demand impatiently and insist incessantly on the
> blessings we want and believe we deserve.

Certainly (and gratefully!), neither Evelyn nor I had cancer, but our situation
was nonetheless similar in kind, if not in extremity. We recognized that we,
like them, needed to have the faith not to receive our desired blessing.

Later that week, we read part of _The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Brené Brown, and
came to the section on faith. In it, Brown quotes theologian Richard Rohr:

> My scientist friends have come up with things like ‘principles of uncertainty’
> and dark holes. They’re willing to live inside imagined hypotheses and
> theories. But many religious folks insist on answers that are always true. We
> love closure, resolution and clarity, while thinking that we are people of
> ‘faith’! How strange that the very word ‘faith’ has come to mean its exact
> opposite.

That was the kind of faith John and Heather had had to exercise. Faith to
accept, acknowledge, and perhaps even embrace uncertainty.

As I've pondered and studied that idea since then, I've encountered it
everywhere, such as in Hebrews 11:13-16:

> **13** These [the individuals Paul mentions in the preceding verses] all died in
> faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and
> were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were
> strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
>
> **14** For they that say such
> things declare plainly that they seek a country.
>
> **15** And truly, if they had
> been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had
> opportunity to have returned.
>
> **16** But now they desire a better country, that
> is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
> hath prepared for them a city.

The people Paul speaks of in this scripture faced uncertainty about both _when_
and _how_ the Lord would fulfill His promises to them.

A few days later, I was reminded of Alma 26:22, which was quoted a lot on my
mission:

> **22** Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works,
> and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the
> mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which
> never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring
> thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring
> these our brethren to repentance

On my mission, this scripture was interpreted almost as a sort of "recipe"---if
you do these things you _will_ baptize converts. But when I considered it in the
context of "faith to accept uncertainty," I realized something interesting:
Enos^[One of the authors of the Book of Mormon, who wrote
[one powerful and well-known chapter](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng)]
_also_ did all of the things mentioned in that verse:

* Repent and exercise faith:
  [verses 1-8 of his record](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p8#p1).
* Do good works:
  [verses 19-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19).
* Pray continually, earnestly, and with sincerity:
  [verses 1-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p18#p1).

However, Enos specifically says he and his fellow missionaries were
_unsuccessful_ in their attempts to teach the then-unbelieving
Lamanites^[[Verse 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20):
"But our labors were vain"]. The promise in Alma 26 wasn't fulfilled for Enos
until 330 years later (which, ironically, was the occasion for the great teacher
Ammon uttering the words previously quoted from Alma 26). Faith to embrace
uncertainty is what enabled Enos to keep going even when he did not obtain the
outcome he hoped for. I'm sure Satan wanted him to doubt himself, but he was
able to say, "I know God will eventually redeem the Lamanites, but I don't know
when or how, and that's ok."

## Certainty and Uncertainty

There _is_ an element of certainty in effectual faith. This can be seen in
[Alma 32:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p21#p21):

> And now as I said concerning faith---faith is not to have a perfect knowledge
> of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen,
> which are true.

There must be some true idea in which we believe in order for us to have faith.
But that's exactly where rejecting uncertainty undermines our faith: rejecting
uncertainty leads us to hold _false_ beliefs, like "if I do the things in Alma
26:22 then I _will_ baptize people on my mission." You can't have effectual
faith by believing something that's false. As Bruce R. McConkie put it, "there
is no power in believing a false doctrine." Such belief is inert, and often a
stumbling block.

To see why false certainty is a hindrance, I found it helpful to examine
knowledge, faith, and false certainty using the _justified true belief_ (JTB)
model of knowledge. These three qualities---truth, belief of that truth, and
justification of that belief---are necessary components of knowledge.

If knowledge is _justified_ true belief, faith is, inherently, _unjustified_
true belief. This can be seen in the verse from Alma 21 quoted earlier---faith
is a belief in "things which are not seen," or, in other words, not justified.
If truth, belief, and justification are necessary components of knowledge, then
truth, belief, and _a lack of justification_ are equally necessary components of
faith. As Alma says in the same chapter: "if a man knoweth a thing he hath no
cause to believe [meaning no cause to exert faith], for he knoweth it."

The third case, false certainty, is unjustified _false_ belief. **TODO: elaborate**

**TODO: expand on why false certainty eventually leads to stagnation, pride, and
disbelief, e.g. "it is not reasonable that such a being as Christ shall come".
Perhaps rework Hess article and doubt quote into here, or move into its own
section.**

Thus, we need to cultivate _both_ the willingness to admit what we do not
know---what is sometimes called epistemic humility---_and_ the courage to hold
firm convictions in what we do know. It is a delicate interaction, of the kind
that Ross Ellenhorn refers to as a _both-and proposition_,^[_How We Change (And
Ten Reasons Why We Don't)_] as opposed to an either-or proposition. We need
_both_ conviction _and_ epistemic humility if we are to move forward with faith
in the face of uncertainty.

## Balancing Conviction and Epistemic Humility

Jacob Hess discusses this delicate balance in
[this excellent article in Public Square Magazine](https://publicsquaremag.org/faith/gospel-fare/conviction-is-no-sin/).
He warns of prioritizing either of these ideas at the cost of the other:

> **TODO: quote Hess?**

Hess mentions "epistemic humility as a barrier to new knowledge," or, in other
words, being too certain that something is uncertain and not seeking further
light. Certainly, this is something we should be wary of.

However, particularly when it comes to how things will happen in the future, I
believe that the way the Lord reveals additional knowledge is most often by
allowing us to simply witness His will as events proceed, rather than revealing
what will happen in detail to us beforehand. Desiring that the future be
revealed to us "up front" can too easily become a stipulation on our continued
faithful action. This is, ironically, a position of doubt:

> [W]hen people doubt their beliefs, they often suspend their commitment to
> commandments and covenants while waiting for answers. The doubter’s posture is
> generally to withhold obedience or limit it, pending resolution of the doubts.
>
> ...
>
> [A key] problem with doubt is the intent to obey only _after_ the uncertainty
> is resolved to the satisfaction of the
> doubter.^[["When Doubts and Questions Arise,"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2015/03/when-doubts-and-questions-arise?lang=eng) March 2015 Ensign]

As such, while we should seek knowledge, we should be open to that knowledge
coming through experience rather than through a priori revelation.
