title: Explicability Does Not Negate Agency
description: Our decisions are still decisions, even though they are explainable via external stimuli.

Perhaps the greatest exposition of human agency in Latter-Day Saint scripture is
[the second chapter of 2 Nephi](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2),
in the Book of Mormon. In it, the prophet Lehi teaches his son Jacob about why
[the Fall of Adam](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-6-the-fall-of-adam-and-eve)
and
[the Atonement of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-12-the-atonement)
of Jesus Christ were both necessary parts of God's plan.

As I reread this chapter recently, I noticed that
[verse 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?id=p16#p16)
connects to something I have been thinking about lately: the idea that
explicability---or the ability of something to be explained---does not eliminate
agency.

A common argument against the existence of free will is the idea that everything
a person does can be explained by some cause or causes external to that person.
If I eat, it is because I am hungry. If I drive cautiously, it is because I have
learned through my past experiences to do so. Therefore, some assert, _all_
human actions were bound to happen as a result of the external forces that led
to those behaviors (an idea known as _determinism_).

The school of psychological thought known as
[behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism), popularized in the
early 1900's, has been used as a basis for making these assertions. The
influential behaviorist psychologist B. F. Skinner asserted that free will was a
myth, and an idea that should be discarded.

In opposition to this "explicability negates agency" viewpoint, Lehi instead
says that explicability is a _necessary part_ of agency:

> 16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.
> Wherefore, **man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed
> by the one or the other.**

People don't do things that don't have explanations. And yet, at the same time,
there may be multiple explicable decisions in a given situation. For example,
when I feel hurt by another person, I can either respond with hurtfulness in
kind, or I can choose to acknowledge my hurt without retaliating. Either of
those choices is explicable---after making either choice, I could point to
something in my past that led to that choice. But that does not eliminate my
ability and responsibility to choose.

I'm reminded of a quote by Victor Frankl: "Between stimulus and response there
is a space. In that space lies our power to choose our response. In our response
lies our growth and our freedom." Each potential response is still capable of
being explained by the given stimulus, but we choose our response nonetheless.
