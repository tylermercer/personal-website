Perhaps the greatest exposition of human agency in Latter-Day Saint scripture is
[the second chapter of 2 Nephi](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2),
in the Book of Mormon. In it, the prophet Lehi teaches his son Jacob about why
the Fall of Adam and the Atonement of Jesus Christ were both necessary parts of
God's plan.

As I reread this chapter recently, I noticed that
[verse 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?id=p16#p16)
connects to something I have been thinking about lately: the idea that
explicability---or the ability of something to be explained---does not eliminate
agency.

One common argument against free will is the idea that everything a person does
can be explained by some cause or causes external to that person. If I eat, it
is because I am hungry. If I drive cautiously, it is because I have learned
through my past experiences to do so. Therefore, some assert, _all_ human
actions were bound to happen as a result of the external forces that led to
those behaviors (an idea known as _determinism_).

The behaviorism school of psychological thought, popularized in the early
1900's, leads many to this position. The influential behaviorist B. F. Skinner
asserted that free will was a myth, and an idea that should be discarded.

In opposition to this "explicability negates agency" viewpoint, Lehi instead
says that explicability is a _necessary part_ of agency:

> 16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.
> Wherefore, **man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed
> by the one or the other.**

People don't do things that don't have explanations; this is true. And yet, at
the same time, there may be multiple explicable decisions in a given situation.
For example, when I feel hurt by another person, I can either respond with
hurtfulness in kind, or I can choose to acknowledge my hurt without retaliating.
Either of those choices is explicable---there are valid reasons to make either
choice. But that does not eliminate my ability and responsibility to choose.

I'm reminded of a great quote by Victor Frankl: "Between stimulus and response
there is a space. In that space lies our power to choose our response. In our
response lies our growth and our freedom." Each potential response is still
capable of being explained by the given stimulus, but we choose our response
nonetheless.
