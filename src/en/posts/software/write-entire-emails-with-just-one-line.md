Email platform [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/)^[Superhuman apparently
receives rave reviews from its customers. I can't make any claims about its
overall usefulness, having never used it. This article is just addressing the AI
feature.] has this blurb on their landing page:

> **Introducing Superhuman AI**<br/>
> Write entire emails with just one line

They then show an example of using their AI service to generate an email. The
prompt `ask the team to upvote the new launch on producthunt` is shown, followed
by this email (the `...`'s denote the edge of the visible portion
of the email in the image):

> Hi team,
>
> I am thrilled about our recent product launch! ðŸŽ‰ ...<br/>
> ProductHunt is a great platform for tapping into ...<br/>
> and gaining exposure for our product. However, ...<br/>
> That's why I'm reaching out to ask you for your help ...<br/>
> please take a moment to upvote our product ...<br/>
> ...

In my mind, there's a big hole in this value proposition that is unaddressed:
**Only a masochist would prefer reading that fluffy, corporate-speak^[
Superhuman claims to match your voice, but still. ] email over "hey team please
upvote the new launch on producthunt."** Do you really _need_ an AI to give you
hundreds of words of fluff to replace "hey team please"?

The great irony of it all is that the value prop of "Write entire emails with
just one line" was _always true_. You could always write your emails in the same
amount of words it would take to describe to an AI: just use those words _as the
email itself._

Words are free-as-in-speech, but they aren't free-as-in-beer.^[In this case,
they are "free as in mattress." It's free, but you probably don't want it.] Each
new word is additional cognitive overhead for your readers. Each _unnecessary_
word is just a distraction.

[Richard Lanham](https://english.ucla.edu/people-faculty/lanham-richard/),
creator of
[the Paramedic Method](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paramedic_method.html)
for editing writing, refers to these useless words as "lard." So many new
AI-powered products seem to be commoditizing the production of lard.

Maybe someday someone will go the other way: an AI service that takes a big
fluffy corporate-speak email and boils it down to one line. That would be nice.
