Hi! I'm Tyler, a software engineer, web developer, and design enthusiast.

This website is where I share my thoughts about various
subjects, most notably [software design and development](/posts/software/)
and [my faith](/posts/faith/).

## Software Design & Engineering Ethos

I believe in the power of well-designed software
to improve lives at an
individual and community level.

My approach to software design at the product level
most closely aligns with "libertarian paternalism,"
as described by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein
in  _Nudge_^[_Nudge: The Final Edition: Improving Decisions About Money, Health, and Happiness_, 2021]:

> Our goal, in short, is to help people make the choices
> that they would have made if they had paid full attention
> and possessed complete information, unlimited cognitive ability,
> and complete self-control.

In other words, I aspire to build software that works _with_
the user to improve the wellbeing of the user and those with whom
the user interacts.

To that end, I completed a minor in psychology as part of my
university studies, and have continued since then to study
psychology informally.

I also love learning about different technologies, architectures,
and tools that can help me achieve this. I am firmly against
the "use one tool for everything" approach that
can often be seen in today's web development industry.

While I have dabbled in native development in the past,
nowadays I am firmly web-first.
That might seem contradictory with my previous statement
about picking the best tool, but to me,
that point is what justifies this one.
The web _is_ the best tool to achieve the goals of my projects--to
reach people on every platform, without being restricted by
oppressive app-store policies and fees,
and to contribute to an open, accessible, performant, and
truly _worldwide_ web.
The web is _the single greatest tool for communication and
creativity ever invented by mankind_^[I plan to write more about this someday],
and is _inherently widely accessible_--all you need is a web browser.
It's also distributed by design and governed by open standards
rather than by a large corporate organization.
You won't find any other widely-used development platform
with those characteristics.^[Chris Coyier shares some great thoughts
about these concepts in [this article](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/04/what-does-it-look-like-for-the-web-to-lose/).]

## My Faith

I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Some of my core beliefs:

* All people are children of God. God loves all His children.
* Because God loves us, He sent Jesus Christ to take upon Himself our
  sufferings, sin, and mortality in an event called the Atonement.
* As a result of the Atonement, we can be made "at one" with God and
  those we love. The Atonement of Christ enables us to receive
  _grace_, which makes it possible for us to do and become better.
* Jesus Christ also provides spiritual _light_, which the scriptures call
  _the Light of Christ_, which is that influence deep inside each
  person that calls him or her towards goodness, other-centeredness,
  intelligence, and sound principles. This light can be seen througout
  the world, in every culture, and across history.

I hope that [my writings about my faith](/posts/faith) can capture
the sense of wonder that I feel about those ideas and how I see them
in the world. I also hope that what I write can be accessible to anyone,
regardless of what they believe. God's light can be found in all of us.
