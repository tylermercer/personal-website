The other day I read
[the guide to this week's Come, Follow Me](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-new-testament-2023/39?lang=eng),
which covers 2 Corinthians 8-13. The introduction to the guide talks about
chapters 8 and 9 specifically, and quotes chapter 9 verse 7:

> Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not
> grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver

After expounding this verse for a bit, the introduction ends with "Whatever
forms our sacrifices take, it’s worth examining our motivations for giving. Are
our sacrifices expressions of love? After all, it’s love that makes a giver
cheerful."

## Love and cheerful giving

I thought this last thought---"it's love that makes a giver cheerful"---was
worth thinking about more deeply. After some consideration, I saw at least seven
ways "love" plays into a person's experience giving to someone in need:

### 1 - The giver loves the recipient by choosing to feel compassion

Upon seeing the recipient, the giver loves the recipient by choosing a mental
attitude of compassion or empathy for their plight, rather than a mindset of
accusation (e.g.
[Mosiah 4:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)'s
example of "the man has brought upon himself his misery") or toxic individualism
("I've got my own problems" or "I don't want to get involved"). Note *love* is a
verb here.

### 2 - The giver loves the recipient through giving

The giver loves the recipient by giving them what they lack (whether that is some
physical resource like money, or something like time, a listening ear,
friendship, etc.). They resist the siren call of the bystander effect (see also:
the parable of the Good Samaritan). Note *love* is again a verb.

### 3 - The giver feels love for the recipient

This is the first time we see *love* as a noun.^[One could argue that the
feeling of compassion or empathy is *love* as a noun, but I see it as primarily
a verb---we must choose compassion.] It might seem strange to place this feeling
of love *after* the action of love, but both modern psychology and the teachings
of latter-day prophets show us that this is indeed the case.

In his BYU devotional from May 1986, Robert E. Wells of the Seventy taught this
principle powerfully:

> [L]ove [for others] comes from our serving and sacrificing for *them*. For
> example, our Heavenly Father loves us, not because we deserve it but because
> he has given and sacrificed for us. Our Savior Jesus Christ loves us, not
> because we deserve it but because he has given so much and sacrificed for us.
> Our parents love us, not because we deserve it but because they have given so
> much and sacrificed for us. In order for us to love others, we must give and
> sacrifice for them. The more we give and the more we sacrifice, the more we
> will love them and forgive them their weaknesses, and the greater will be our
> tendency toward mercy. Unfortunately, some young people do not understand
> this. When they don’t love their parents or brothers and sisters or roommates,
> they tend to think it is because parents or others have not earned their love
> or do not deserve it. It is the other way around! If you do not love someone
> as much as you should, it is because *you* have not yet given enough nor
> sacrificed enough for your parents or for that brother or sister or roommate.

In psychology, this effect is sometimes termed
[the Ben Franklin effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect),
after Benjamin Franklin, who described "an old maxim"
[in his autobiography](https://web.archive.org/web/20150118172814/http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page48.htm):

> "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another,
> than he whom you yourself have obliged."

Studies have confirmed what Franklin observed: that someone who previously
helped you is likely to be more willing to help you again than someone who you
have helped. We tend to think more favorably of those to whom we have done kind
things. One theory as to why this is is that we seek to reduce the *cognitive
dissonance* of harboring negative perceptions of someone we have served, and
that reduction in dissonance often comes by our letting go of those negative
perceptions.

### 4 - The recipient feels love for the giver

This one may not always occur (such as in cases where the person did not want to
be helped or is unaware of being helped) but often the recipient of a good deed
feels an increase in love towards the doer of that good deed.

### 5 - The giver feels God's love for the recipient

To bring this back to a spiritual context, God blesses us with a portion of *His
love* for others when we serve them. The ancient prophet Mormon described this,
at the end of the sermon recorded in Moroni
7:^[[Moroni 7:47-48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p48#p48),
emphasis mine]

> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of
> heart, that ye may be filled with *this love, which he hath bestowed upon all
> who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ*; that ye may become the sons
> of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him
> as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is
> pure. Amen.

Serving others is part of being a disciple of Jesus Christ, who spent His entire
earthly ministry doing so, and Mormon promises that those who are disciples of
Christ will be filled with God's love.

### 6 - The giver feels God's love for them

This connects back to the passage in 2 Corinthians from earlier: "God loveth a
cheerful giver." When we serve others genuinely, we can feel God's love for us.
I believe that this love is a manifestation of His paternal joy in seeing us
bless others as He does---much as a parent feels tenderness and love when his or
her children are kind to each other.

### 7 - The recipient feels God's love for them

This one, again, may not always occur---it depends on the state of the
recipient. But this idea reminds me of
[the story of Chris Williams](https://youtu.be/E7zwQ_7q-fU), who lost his wife
and several children in a horrific car crash caused by a drunk driver. After the
incident, Chris knew he needed to forgive the driver, and relied upon the grace
of Christ to do so. Eventually, he met up with Cameron, the teenager who had
been driving the other car. This is how Williams described that meeting:

> The thought and sentiment that I expressed as I sat down with Cameron was
> simply this, that if through the forgiveness through anything else he had seen
> or heard about me doing, after the accident, that he should know, it was
> merely the Savior working through me. I had merely put myself in a situation
> to be a vessel, through which the Spirit, through which His example, through
> which His knowledge, His experience, His brilliance, could shine.

Chris (the giver, in this case of forgiveness) pointed Cameron (the recipient)
towards God and His love.

I think this experience of love, perhaps together with #3 and #5, is arguably
_the point_ of our service. We serve so that others can feel the Savior's love,
and so that we can feel the Savior's love for others as we grow to become more
like Him.

## Good measure, pressed down, and running over

It is powerful to me to note how only two of these seven experiences of love are
_love as a verb_---things we do. The remainder are _love as a received
experience_---something we feel. I am reminded of how Jesus taught us to
give,^[[Luke 6:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p38#p38)]
and the result He promised:

> Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken
> together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.

I suspect that the experiences of love we receive through service are a big part
of that "good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over" of
which He spoke.
