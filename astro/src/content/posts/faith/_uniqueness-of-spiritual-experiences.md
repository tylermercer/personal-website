A few years ago, as I was reading
[Alma 19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng),
it struck me as very interesting that Abish did not receive the same
immobilizing manifestation of the Spirit that the other servants did. It seems
that this was specific wisdom in God, since she was able to go and run and
gather the rest of the people to see what the Lord had done for the king and his
household.

This, to me, makes an interesting point: we should not feel less important or
valued when we do not have spiritual experiences or receive revelation^[For
readers who may not be familiar with this term, _revelation_ is when God speaks
to humans. The scriptures record many dramatic instances of revelation, such as
through visions or dreams, but many individuals receive revelation through
feelings, thoughts, or impressions.] in the same way others do. Abish may never
have had an experience like the kind described here in her entire life. The text
says she was converted "on account of a remarkable vision of her father," which
likely means that she heard her father's account of a vision he saw and trusted
him, not that she herself had a vision.

Often, when we have a firm faith in Christ but haven't had any (or don't
remember any) particularly amazing or miraculous experiences, we can be tempted
to feel that our testimony^[ A _testimony_ is a witness of spiritual truth,
often about Heavenly Father or His son Jesus Christ, borne to a person's heart
and mind by the Holy Ghost. ] is weaker than, inferior to, or less valid than
those of others. As a result, we often don't "give ourselves permission" to be
spiritually strong. We don't allow ourselves to bear testimony clearly and
sincerely, since we feel that we haven't earned the right to make direct or firm
claims about spiritual truth. Deep down we have a nagging doubt that our light
isn't "good enough."

But whether it is obtained through an instantaneous light-switch experience or
through a gradual sunrise experience,^[ Elder Bednar teaches about these
different ways of experiencing light in the Church's
["Patterns of Light" videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrxrX4-JjqEMOU52TiD2R7is8lAjMZ_8v).]
light is still light, and we have each been given light in unique ways. Back to
Abish's story: if she had had the same experience as the other servants, no one
would have been left to go and gather the remainder of the people. Because of
her unique experiences---the experiences she _did_ have, as well as those she
unexpectedly did _not_ have---Abish was able to be a powerful instrument in
bringing the joy of the gospel into the lives of people she knew and loved.

God blesses others through each of our unique voices and perspectives. He
invites us to share the light that we've been given. We each have the capacity
to touch and uplift those around us in ways that no one else can. And in our
learning, we do not "earn" grand spiritual manifestations; rather, spiritual
experiences of all kinds are, in the words of the ancient prophet Mormon, "sent
forth by the power and gift of Christ"^[
[Moroni 7:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)]---in
other words, we receive revelatory experiences because of Jesus Christ. He gives
them to us for our benefit as we are willing to receive them, and He does so in
the way that is best for each of us individually, to bless us and to bless His
other children through us.
