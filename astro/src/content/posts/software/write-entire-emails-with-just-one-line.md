Email platform [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/)^[Superhuman apparently
receives rave reviews from its customers. I can't make any claims about its
overall usefulness, having never used it. This article is just addressing the AI
feature described on the landing page.] has this blurb on their landing page:

> **Introducing Superhuman AI**<br/>
> Write entire emails with just one line

They then show an example of using their AI service to generate an email. The
prompt `ask the team to upvote the new launch on producthunt` is shown, followed
by this email (the `...`'s denote the edge of the visible portion
of the email in the image):

> Hi team,
>
> I am thrilled about our recent product launch! 🎉 ...<br/>
> ProductHunt is a great platform for tapping into ...<br/>
> and gaining exposure for our product. However, ...<br/>
> That's why I'm reaching out to ask you for your help ...<br/>
> please take a moment to upvote our product ...<br/>
> ...

In my mind, there's a big hole in this value proposition: **nobody wants to read
this kind of email.** Only a masochist would prefer reading a fluffy,
corporate-speak email over "hey team please upvote the new launch on
producthunt."^[ Superhuman claims to match your voice, but still. ] Do you
really need an AI to give you hundreds of extra words to use instead of "hey
team please"?

The value prop of "Write entire emails with just one line" has always been true.
You could _always_ write your emails in the same amount of words it would take
to describe to an AI: just use those words _as the email itself._

Words are free-as-in-speech, but they aren't free-as-in-beer. In this case, they
are free-as-in-mattress: it's free, but no one wants it. Each unnecessary word
is just additional cognitive overhead for your readers.

[Richard Lanham](https://english.ucla.edu/people-faculty/lanham-richard/),
creator of
[the Paramedic Method](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paramedic_method.html)
for editing writing, refers to these useless words as "lard." So many new
AI-powered products seem to be commoditized lard-generators.

Someone should go the other way: build an AI service that takes a big fluffy
corporate-speak email and boils it down to one concise line. _That_ would be
nice.
